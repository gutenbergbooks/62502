<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>In perusing the following pages, readers, who may be specially
interested in some one particular parish with which they are
connected, may in certain cases be disappointed on not finding
such parish here described, as they have previously seen it,
along with the others, in the columns of the &ldquo;Horncastle
News,&rdquo; where these &lsquo;Records&rsquo; first
appeared.&nbsp; This may arise from one of two causes:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; The volume published in 1899, entitled
&ldquo;Records of Woodhall Spa and Neighbourhood&rdquo; (which
was very favourably received), contained accounts of parishes
extending from Somersby and Harrington in the east of the
district, to Horsington and Bucknall in the west, with others
between; as being likely to interest visitors to that growing
health resort.&nbsp; These, therefore, do not find a place in
this volume.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; Further it is proposed that in the near future this
volume shall be followed by a &ldquo;History of
Horncastle,&rdquo; already approaching completion, and with it
accounts of the fourteen parishes within its
&ldquo;soke.&rdquo;&nbsp; These, again, are, consequently, not
here given.</p>
<p>The Records of all these different parishes will be found in
the volumes to which they respectively belong.</p>
<p>In again submitting a work of this character to the many
friends whom his former volume has gained for him, the author
wishes to say that he is himself fully alive to its
imperfections; none could be more so.&nbsp; In not a few
instances it has, almost perforce, come short of his own aim and
aspirations; the material available in connection with some of
the parishes described having proved meagre beyond
expectation.&nbsp; In many chains links have been lost; there are
gaps&mdash;in some cases a yawning hiatus&mdash;which it has been
found impossible to fill.</p>
<p><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>Further, as the account of each parish was intended
originally to be complete in itself, and several parishes have,
at different periods, had the same owners, there will be found,
of necessity, some cases of repetition as to individuals, their
character, or incidents connected with them.</p>
<p>Anyone who reads the book will see that it has involved no
small amount of labour; whether in visiting (always on foot) the
many localities described (in all more than 70 parishes having
been visited); or in the careful search and research, necessary
in many directions, for the information required.</p>
<p>In both these respects, however, the task has been a congenial
one, and of more or less engrossing interest, thus bringing its
own reward.</p>
<p>It has been said by a thoughtful writer that no one can enjoy
the country so thoroughly as the pedestrian who passes through it
leisurely.</p>
<p>We all, instinctively (if not vitiated), have a love of the
country.&nbsp; As Cowper has said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis born with all; the love of
Nature&rsquo;s works<br />
Is an ingredient in the compound man,<br />
Infused at the creation of his kind.&rdquo;&mdash;(&ldquo;The
Task.&rdquo;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not, however, the cyclist, who rushes through our rural
charms with head in the position of a battering ram, and frame
quivering with the vibration engendered of his vehicle, who can
dwell on these attractions with full appreciation.&nbsp; Nor is
it his more reckless brother, the motorist, who crashes along our
country roads, with powers of observation narrowed by hideous
binocular vizor, and at a speed whose centrifugal force drives in
terror every other wayfarer&mdash;chicken, child, woman, or
man&mdash;to fly like sparks from anvil in all directions, if
haply they may even so escape destruction.&nbsp; For him, we
might suppose, the fascination must be to outstrip the
thunderbolt, not to linger over mundane scenery.&nbsp; But to the
man who walks deliberately, and with an observant eye for all
about him, to him indeed nature unfolds her choicest
treasures.&nbsp; Not only antiquities such as the British, Roman,
or Danish camps on the hill sides above him have their special
attractions; but the very hedge-rows and banks, with their wealth
of flower and of insect life, the quarries with their different
fossils, the ice-borne boulders scattered about, and even the
local, and often quaint, human <a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>characters, whom he may meet and
chat with.&nbsp; All these afford him sources of varied interest
as well as instruction.</p>
<p>The process, again, of antiquarian investigation is absorbing
and recuperative, alike to man and matter, bringing to life, as
it were, habits and customs long buried in the
&ldquo;limbo&rdquo; of the past, re-clothing dry bones with
flesh, uniting those no longer articulate; like the kilted
warriors springing to their feet, on all sides, from the heather,
at the signal of some Rhoderick Dhu.&nbsp; Here also, albeit, the
recording MSS and folios may be &ldquo;fusty,&rdquo; knights of
old are summoned up, as by a long forgotten roll-call, to fight
their battles over again; or high-born dames and &ldquo;ladyes
fayre,&rdquo; may unfold anew unknown romances.</p>
<p>With our span-new Rural, Urban and County Councils, we are apt
to fancy that only now, in this twentieth century, is our little
world awakening to real activity; but the antiquary, as by a
magician&rsquo;s wand, can conjure up scenes dispelling such
illusions; and anyone, who reads the following pages, may see
that the humblest of our rural villages may have had a past of
stirring incident, which must be little short of a revelation to
most of its present occupants, &ldquo;not dreamt of in their
simple philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the calls of other duties, to one whose occupations are
by no means limited to this particular field of labour, the work
had often, of necessity, to be suspended, and so its continuity
was liable to be broken into a collection of <i>disjecta corporis
membra</i>.&nbsp; Such, however, as they are, the author submits
these &lsquo;Records&rsquo; to future generous readers, in the
confident hope that they will make due allowance for the varied
difficulties with which he has had to contend.</p>
<p>He could wish the results attained were more worthy of their
acceptance; but he has some satisfaction in the feeling that, in
his humble degree, he has opened up, as it were, a new world
(though still an old one) for their contemplation.</p>
<p>A popular writer has said: &ldquo;To realise the charm and
wealth of interest of a country side, even in one&rsquo;s
armchair, is an intellectual pleasure of no mean
order.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the old-time incidents found in the
following pages enliven some of our modern &ldquo;ingle
neuks,&rdquo; the author will, in some degree, have gained his
reward.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>NOTES ON
PARISHES ROUND HORNCASTLE.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">Ashby Puerorum</span></h3>
<p>is situated about five miles from Horncastle in an eastern
direction, lying between Somersby on the north-east, Greetham
nearly west, and Hagworthingham almost south.&nbsp; It includes
the hamlets of Stainsby and Holbeck.&nbsp; The register dates
from 1627.&nbsp; Letters, via Horncastle, arrive at 10 a.m.&nbsp;
At Tetford is the nearest money order and telegraph office,
although there is in the village an office where postal orders
and stamps can be obtained.&nbsp; The principal owners of land
are Earl Manvers, the representatives of the late Mr. Pocklington
Coltman, of Hagnaby Priory, and F. W. S. Heywood, Esq., of
Holbeck Hall.&nbsp; The antiquity of the parish is implied in its
name.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ash&rdquo; is the Danish &ldquo;esshe&rdquo;
(the pronunciation still locally used), and &ldquo;by&rdquo; is
Danish for &ldquo;farmstead.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, the whole of
the neighbourhood was overrun by the Danish Vikings, as is shewn
by the termination &ldquo;by,&rdquo; which is almost universal,
as in Stainsby, Somersby, three Enderbys, Spilsby, etc.&nbsp; The
ash was probably the &ldquo;moot&rdquo; tree of the village,
beneath whose spreading shade the elders sat in council.&nbsp;
This tree was formerly held sacred.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;world-tree,&rdquo; or &ldquo;holy ash&rdquo; of the Danish
mythology (called by the <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Druids &ldquo;Yggdrasil&rdquo;) was
supposed to have its top in heaven and its roots in hell <a
name="citation2a"></a><a href="#footnote2a"
class="citation">[2a]</a> (&ldquo;Asgard and the Gods,&rdquo; by
Wagner).&nbsp; I am aware that another derivation has been
suggested, viz., that &ldquo;ash&rdquo; represents the Norse
&ldquo;is,&rdquo; &ldquo;use,&rdquo; &ldquo;uisge&rdquo; (compare
river Ouse), all of which mean &ldquo;water,&rdquo; as in
Ashbourne, where the latter syllable is only a later translation
of the former, both meaning water.&nbsp; But I cannot see that
water is so prominent a local feature as to give a name to this
parish, nor to the other Ashbys in the neighbourhood. <a
name="citation2b"></a><a href="#footnote2b"
class="citation">[2b]</a></p>
<p>The oldest official notice of the parish is in Domesday Book,
where it is stated that &ldquo;in Aschebi, Odincarle
(Wodin&rsquo;s churl) and Chilbert had 4 carucates (<i>i.e.</i>,
480 acres) rateable&rdquo; to the tax called &ldquo;gelt,&rdquo;
their whole land being 5 carucates or 600 acres.&nbsp; This was
in Saxon times.&nbsp; When William the Conqueror took possession
these were deprived of their property, and he bestowed the manor
on Odo, Bishop of Baieux, who was his half-brother on the
mother&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; On the bishop coming to England,
William created him Earl of Kent, and also Count Palatine, and
&ldquo;Justitiarius Angli&aelig;.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was so powerful
that historians of the day described him as &ldquo;Totius
Angli&aelig; Vice-dominus sub rege,&rdquo; second only to the
King.&nbsp; He held, of the King&rsquo;s gift, 76 manors in
Lincolnshire, besides 463 in other parts.&nbsp; This greatness,
however, was his ruin, for, from his pride and arrogancy, he
incurred the Conqueror&rsquo;s displeasure and was sent to prison
in Normandy.&nbsp; On the Conqueror&rsquo;s death, in 1084, King
Rufus restored him to his honours, but, finding his power not so
great as formerly, he headed a conspiracy against Rufus in favour
of Robert, Duke of Normandy, and, failing in it, he fled to the
Duke, who <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>made him governor of that Province, where he died in
1097.&nbsp; Ashby Puerorum was thus again &ldquo;in the
market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subsequent history of Ashby is more or less enveloped in
the folding mists of antiquity.&nbsp; The clouds, however, do
here and there lift a little, and we get a glimpse into the past
which enables us to form a shrewd guess as to its early
proprietors.&nbsp; Among the list of noble soldiers contained in
the famous &ldquo;Battle Roll&rdquo; of the Conqueror, as coming
over with him to England and fighting for him at Hastings, is the
name of Creuquere, or Creveceur, Latinized as &ldquo;De corde
Crepito,&rdquo; which some have rendered &ldquo;of the craven
heart,&rdquo; not a very likely attribute of a brave
soldier.&nbsp; We prefer another rendering, &ldquo;of the tender
heart,&rdquo; and connect it with the legend of his rescuing a
&ldquo;ladye fayre&rdquo; at the risk of his own life, who was
kept &ldquo;in durance vile&rdquo; by a knight of ill repute, in
his castle, situated in a lonesome forest.&nbsp; The name also
took the alternative form of De Curcy.&nbsp; A de Curcy was
seneschal, or High Steward, to Henry I., and it is a name which
ranks high still.&nbsp; This Creveceur (we are not sure of his
Christian name) was one of a doughty race.&nbsp; Giraldus
Kambrensis tells us of one of them, who conquered the Irish
kingdom of Ulster in 1177 (Hibernia Expugnata, lib. ii., c. 16,
17), and was created Earl of Ulster.&nbsp; He was of gigantic
stature, and in a dispute between Kings Philip of France and John
of England, the former sent one of his most redoubted knights to
maintain his cause, but, the Creveceur being appointed champion
for John, the Frenchman thought it best to show a clean pair of
heels and shun the combat.&nbsp; In recognition of his valour
this Knight was allowed by King John to wear his hat in the
King&rsquo;s presence, a privilege still enjoyed by Lord Kinsale,
the present representative of the family.&nbsp; Lord Forester had
the same privilege granted by Henry VIII.</p>
<p>Now the Creveceurs were lords of considerable territory in the
neighbourhood of Ashby; for instance, at Bag Enderby, Somersby,
Tetford, etc., and in the document &ldquo;Testa de Nevill&rdquo;
(circa 1215) it is stated that Hugh Fitz Ralph is tenant, under
the Barony of Cecilia de Creveceur, of lands in Ashby, Tetford,
etc.&nbsp; Other documents lead us back a little further, as an
&ldquo;Assize Roll,&rdquo; of date <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1202, says that the property came
from Matilda de Creveceur, who was the daughter and heir of
Gislebert Fitz Gozelin, who held lands at <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Bag Enderby,
etc., and this last is named as owner in Domesday Book.</p>
<p>Another name now appears.&nbsp; By an Assize Roll of 9 Edw. I.
(<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1280), Thomas de Houton
claims of Robert de Kirketon, and Beatrix his wife, certain
&ldquo;rents and appurtenances in Ashby next Greetham
(<i>i.e.</i>, Ashby Puerorum), Stainsby,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>The Kirketon family would seem eventually to have acquired a
part of the manor of Ashby Puerorum, and from them it passed to
Lord Cromwell of Tattershall.&nbsp; A Chancery Inquisition, held
at Horncastle in 1453, shews that the College at Tattershall held
the advowsons of Ashby Puerorum, Wood Enderby, Moorby, and
several other benefices.&nbsp; By an Inquisition of the same date
and place, the Jurors state that the Manors of Ashby Puerorum and
certain other places belong to the Earl of Albemarle.&nbsp; After
that, at the Dissolution of Religious Houses (Tattershall College
being one), the King granted to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk,
most of their lands in the neighbourhood, including those in
Ashby Puerorum.&nbsp; This brings us down to 1539.&nbsp; In
course of time a general process of dissolution also took place
in ownership of land.&nbsp; The lands owned in this parish by the
Brandons, were sold (22 Elizabeth, <i>i.e.</i>, in 1580) to James
Prescott, gentleman, who married a daughter of Sir Richard
Molineux, Knight.&nbsp; He had a son, John, whose widow married
Lord Willoughby of Parham (Architect. S. Journal vol. xxiii., pp.
128, 9).&nbsp; By a Feet of Fines, held at Lincoln, of the same
date, it is shewn that George Gedney, Esq., and his descendents,
also had lands in this parish in 20 Henry VII. (<span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1504), etc. (Ibidem. p. 27.)&nbsp;
All these lands ultimately passed to Tattershall College.&nbsp;
But even before that date it would appear, by a Chancery
Inquisition, held at Lincoln, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1504, that Joan Eland, <a name="citation4"></a><a
href="#footnote4" class="citation">[4]</a> the widow of Thomas
Gedney, held lands in Ashby Puerorum, Somersby, and other near
places.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Another
prominent family now appears as owning the manor of, or at least
considerable lands in, Ashby Puerorum, viz., the
Wentworths.&nbsp; A tradition remains that Thomas Wentworth, Earl
of Strafford, in the reign of Charles I., and one of his
Sovereign&rsquo;s most faithful adherents, owned the manor of
Greetham.&nbsp; I have not been able fully to verify this, but a
lease of that parish was granted in 1685 (see my account of
Greetham) to Sir William Wentworth, Knight, of Ashby Puerorum,
who was son of Sir William Wentworth, who fell at the battle of
Marston Moor, fighting for Charles I.&nbsp; The Parish Award
shows that Thomas, Earl of Strafford, was Lord of the Manor in
1705.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Architect. Soc. Journal,&rdquo; 1891.)</p>
<p>The succession of the Wentworths to this property probably
came about in this wise.&nbsp; We have seen that it passed from
the Kirketons <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> to Lord Cromwell, and the Cromwells were
succeeded, through a marriage on the female side, by the
Fortescues; and Camden (&ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; p. 266, ed.
1695) tells us that a daughter of Sir Adrian Fortescue (who was
attainted) being heiress of her mother, married the first Baron
Wentworth.</p>
<p>The Wentworths were a very ancient family.&nbsp; They are now
represented by the Earls Fitzwilliam, one of whose names is
Wentworth, and they own the princely residence of Wentworth
Castle, near Rotherham.&nbsp; They trace their descent from Saxon
Royalty, in the person of their ancestor, Sir William Fitz
Godric, cousin to King Edward the Confessor.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Beauties of England.&nbsp; Yorkshire,&rdquo; p. 838.)</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that one of this family, accompanying
William the Conqueror to England, fought so valiantly at the
battle of Hastings that William gave him a scarf from his own arm
(presumably), to stanch a wound.&nbsp; Drake, the historian, in
his &ldquo;Eboracensis,&rdquo; gives plates of the Wentworth
monuments in York Cathedral.&nbsp; The Barony of Wentworth still
survives in the present Lord Wentworth, of Wentworth House,
Chelsea, its creation dating from 1529.</p>
<p>We have now done with the Wentworths.&nbsp; Their property at
Ashby descended, towards the end of the <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>18th century, to Mr. Stevens Dineley
Totton, from whom it passed to Earl Manvers and the Coltman
family.</p>
<p>We now take the hamlet of Stainsby, which lies to the
north-east, distant about a mile, on the right of the road to
Somersby.&nbsp; This was formerly the chief seat, in this
neighbourhood, of the Littlebury family.&nbsp; We mention them in
our Records of various other parishes.&nbsp; There are mural
monuments of them in both Somersby Church and that of Ashby
Puerorum; the former is a small brass, about 10in, broad by 14in.
high, having a kneeling figure of George Littlebury, with the
inscription, &ldquo;Here lyeth George Littleburie of Somersbie,
7th sonne of Thomas Littleburie of Stainsbie, who died the 13th
daye of October, in ye yeare of our Lord 1612, being about the
age of 73 yeares.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Littleburys were a very old
family, coming originally from Littlebury Manor, near Saffron
Walden, in the county of Essex, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1138.&nbsp; One of them was Chief
Justice of England.&nbsp; Subsequently they had a fine residence
at Holbeach Hurn, in South Lincolnshire, and large property in
many other places.&nbsp; We have spoken already of the Kirketons,
as connected with Ashby Puerorum and Sir Humphrey Littlebury,
Knight, whose name appears in the Sheriffs List, in 1324, married
Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Sir John Kirkton (or Kirton),
and so became Lord of Holbeach.&nbsp; Sir John Littlebury <a
name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a"
class="citation">[6a]</a> married a daughter of Thomas Meeres, an
old and wealthy family, also of Kirton, <a
name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a> and it would seem that it was through
this marriage with the Kirtons of Kirton the Littleburys came to
Stainsby.&nbsp; Sir Humphrey was buried in Holbeach Church, where
there is a very fine tomb of him, now in the north aisle, but
formerly &ldquo;before the altar.&rdquo;&nbsp; The effigy is that
of a knight, encased in armour, the hands joined in prayer, the
head resting on a woman&rsquo;s head, which is enclosed in a net,
the feet being supported by a lion.&nbsp; The sides are covered
with roses, and there are four niches, with canopies, which
probably held figures on a smaller scale.&nbsp; Two views of it
are given by C. A. Stoddard, in his &ldquo;Monumental Effigies of
Great Britain&rdquo; (London, 4to., 1817).&nbsp; The actual date
of the <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Littleburys coming to Stainsby cannot be exactly
ascertained, but they were there in the reign of Henry VIII.</p>
<p>A small proprietor in Stainsby is named in a Chancery
Inquisition, 19 Henry VII., No. 20 (<i>i.e.</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1503), viz., John H. Etton, who,
besides several other lands, held &ldquo;one messuage and four
cottages in Bag Enderby, Stanesby and Someresby,&rdquo; which
lands also passed to Tattershall College.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Architect. Soc. Journal,&rdquo; xxiii., p. 21.)</p>
<p>Stainsby (let not my readers be alarmed, for witches and
warlocks are out of fashion in this unimaginative, or sceptical,
age) has not been without its supernatural associations.&nbsp; I
here give a colloquy held, not many months ago, with a quondam
resident.&nbsp; (J. C. W. loquitur. F. C. respondet).&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, C., did you ever hear of a ghost at
Stainsby?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Aye, that I did, mony a year

but I knowed several as did.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where was it

&ldquo;Tell me one or two.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, it were seen
about Stayensby, haaf a mile afore ye come to Somersby, and it
were seen about the esh-planting (notice the &lsquo;esh,&rsquo;
the old Danish pronunciation still surviving, the Danish for
Ashby being Eshe-by), just afore ye go down to the brig
o&rsquo;er the beck.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you name anyone who
saw it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O, many on &rsquo;em, specially gean
the brig.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Name someone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, a waggoner living at Bag Enderby.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What was it like?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, a misty

<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>I will
here give a few extracts from old documents connected with former
owners, which may be of interest from their peculiarity, or
otherwise.</p>
<p>John Gedney, of Bag Enderby, in his will, dated 14 June, 1535,
mentions his lands in Ashby Puerorum and other parishes.</p>
<p>Margaret Littlebury, widow of Thos. Littlebury, Esq., of
Stainsby, by her will, of date 2 January, 1582, requests that she
may be buried in the Church of Ashby Puerorum, &ldquo;near unto
my husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; She bequeaths to the poor of the parish,
as also of Greetham, Salmonby, Somersby, Bag Enderby, and Hagg,
the lease of the Parsonage of Maidenwell; a sheepwalk there to
her sons George and Edward; to her daughter Anne, wife of Thomas
Grantham, &pound;10 (N.B.&mdash;The Granthams still survive); to
her daughter, Elizabeth Fitzwilliam (a good family), &pound;10;
to her daughter, Katherine Wythornwyke, &pound;5; to Thomas
Dighton, son of Christopher Dighton, deceased (a family connected
with several parishes), &pound;10; &ldquo;to Francis Atkinson, my
warrener, 20s.&rdquo; (&ldquo;warrener&rdquo; probably equivalent
to gamekeeper).&nbsp; She refers to a schedule of plate, etc.,
bequeathed by her late husband to his deceased son, Humphrey, to
be handed over to his son Thomas.&nbsp; She was a daughter of
John St. Paul, of Snarford.</p>
<p>Thomas Littlebury, of Ashby, by will, proved June 10th, 1590,
bequeathed to his wife Katherine &pound;100, and &ldquo;one
goblett with gylte cover, two &lsquo;tunnes&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i>,
cups) parcel gilte, 6 silver spoons of the best, my gylte salte I
bought of my uncle Kelke, with a cover.&rdquo;&nbsp; (The Kelkes
were related to the Kirtons of Kirkton).&nbsp; Then follow a
number of bequests of property in various parts of the
county.&nbsp; The husband makes his executors &ldquo;my
father-in-law, Charles Dymoke, my cousins Andrew Gedney and
Thomas Copledike.&rdquo;&nbsp; (N.B.&mdash;These are the
Copledikes, of whom so many monuments exist in Harrington
Church.)</p>
<p>George Littlebury, of Somersby, by will, dated 10 Sept., 1612,
requests to be buried &ldquo;in the Queare of Somersby
Church,&rdquo; and leaves 2s. to it, and 1s. to Ashby Church, and
1s. to Lincoln Cathedral.&nbsp; He wishes a stone to be placed
over his grave, and his arms set in the wall, as his
father&rsquo;s were at Ashby.&nbsp; (N.B.&mdash;Both these stones
and brasses still exist.)</p>
<p>When the Spanish Armada was expected, among the <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>gentry who
contributed to the defence of the country, at the Horncastle
Sessions, 1586&ndash;7, was &ldquo;John Littlebury of
Hagworthingham Esq. ij. light horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the same
time &ldquo;Thomas Littlebery of Staynsby Esq. [furnished] j.
launce [and] j. light horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the
&ldquo;Rising&rdquo; in Lincolnshire (1536) against Henry VIII.,
on the Dissolution of the Monasteries, a previous John Littlebury
was just deceased, but his son Humphrey took part in it, as also
did Robert Littlebury, who was probably a son of Thomas
Littlebury, of Stainsby.</p>
<p>The Littleburys and the Langtons of Langton intermarried more
than once.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry VIII., Rose, daughter of
John Littlebury of Hagworthingham, married John Langton, and in
the next century (about 1620) Troth. daughter of Thomas
Littlebury of Ashby Puerorum, married a son of Sir John Langton,
Knt., High Sheriff of Lincolnshire.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Architect. Soc.
Journal,&rdquo; vol. xxii., pp. 166&ndash;7).&nbsp; Probably it
was owing to this connection that we find that Sir John Langton,
of Langton, by his will, dated 25 Sept., 1616, leaves 20s. to the
poor of Ashby, Langton, and several other places.&nbsp;
(N.B.&mdash;I am indebted for these particulars to
&ldquo;Lincolnshire Wills,&rdquo; edited by Canon Maddison of
Lincoln.)</p>
<p>The second half of the name of this parish of Ashby Puerorum
is derived from the fact that the rent of certain lands in the
parish were assigned towards the support of the choristers of
Lincoln Cathedral, which is now raised by a general rate of the
parish, and, accordingly, the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln are
patrons of the benefice, a vicarage <a name="citation9"></a><a
href="#footnote9" class="citation">[9]</a> which is now held by
the Rev. Robert Ward, who resides at Hagworthingham.</p>
<p>One of the early Norman Barons, probably Gislebert Fitz
Gozelin, erected here a gallows (Hundred Rolls, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1275).&nbsp; The site of this is not
now known, unless it may be traced in a part of the parish lying
in an easterly direction from the village, and named
&ldquo;Knowles,&rdquo; possibly a corruption for &ldquo;Knoll
Hill,&rdquo; a rising ground on which a gallows might well be
placed as a conspicuous warning <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>for future would-be offenders.&nbsp;
A lane in the parish is called Galley Lane, which again may point
to the former gallows.</p>
<p>Another field-name in the parish is not without interest,
viz., Peaseholme.&nbsp; We have Peasedale gate (<i>i.e.</i>,
road) in Hameringham, Peasegate Lane at Spilsby, Peasewang
(<i>i.e.</i>, field) in High Toynton, and similar names in Louth
and elsewhere.&nbsp; All these are indicating the general use of
pulse as an article of diet in those early times.</p>
<p>Near the western end of the village is a farm named
&ldquo;Clapgate,&rdquo; so called because the fugitive Royalists,
after the battle of Winceby (Oct. 11, 1643), kept a neighbouring
gate clapping all night in their haste to escape.&nbsp; Near this
is a footpath across the fields, which leads to Holbeck Lodge,
and here again, till recently, survived the same name,
&ldquo;Clapgate,&rdquo; because there was formerly a gate near
Holbeck Lodge, on the now high road to Salmonby, which was also
kept in motion by other fugitives, to the disturbance of the
slumbers of those living near.&nbsp; And this brings us to
Holbeck, the other hamlet comprised in the parish of Ashby
Puerorum, commonly described as &ldquo;an extra-parochial
liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name Holbeck contains two Danish, or Norse,
elements.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hol&rdquo; implies a hollow, connected
with our word &ldquo;hole.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have it in the German
Swiss Eulenthal, or hollow dale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beck&rdquo; is
Norse, corresponding to the German &ldquo;bach,&rdquo; as in
Schwabach, Staubbach, Reichenbach, etc.&nbsp; Thus Holbech means
a beck or stream running through a hollow. <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a>&nbsp; The name Holbeck still exists in
Denmark.&nbsp; Thus we have a name, like so many (as already
remarked) in the vicinity, shewing the great immigration of Danes
in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; There is also a Holbeck near Leeds,
to which the Danes, who came up the Humber, extended their
settlements.&nbsp; At the back, to the north of the present
Holbeck Hall, is the rising ground named &ldquo;Hoe
Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; This again indicates the same.&nbsp; <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>The How, or
Hoe, is probably the Norse &ldquo;Hof,&rdquo; a holy place (found
in such names as Ivanhoe, Ivinghoe, Piddinghoe, etc.), or it may
have been the Norse &ldquo;Haughr,&rdquo; a burial place.&nbsp;
In that case it may have been held sacred as the burial place of
some Viking chief, who led his followers in their invasion of the
district.&nbsp; It may be described as a truncated, and rather
obtuse, cone, with a dyke, or scarpment, running round it, like a
collar round the neck.&nbsp; There is a How Hill near
Harrogate.&nbsp; We have also Silver-how, Bull-how, and
Scale-how, which were probably the burial places of the chiefs
Solvar, Boll, and Skall.&nbsp; But whether or not it once served
these purposes, there can be little doubt that it has been a
Danish encampment, and probably a stronghold of the Briton at a
still earlier period.&nbsp; The dyke would form the outer defence
of the height above, from which to charge down upon an enemy,
laboriously breasting the hill, with overwhelming advantage to
the defenders.&nbsp; Geologically, Hoe Hill is interesting, the
ironstone, of which it is composed, being so totally different
from the sandstone of Holbeck below.&nbsp; These lower rocks are
said to be still the haunt of that much-baited, but harmless
animal, the badger.</p>
<p>As to former owners of Holbeck, old title deeds show that it
was formerly the property of Augusta Ann Hatfield Kaye, sister of
Frederick Thomas, Earl of Stafford, who also, as we have seen,
was lord of the manor of Ashby.&nbsp; She died at Wentworth
Castle, and was buried at St. John&rsquo;s Church, Wakefield, May
4, 1802, as I am informed by the present owner, F. W. S. Heywood,
Esq.&nbsp; Old documents, still existing, show that the house at
Holbeck was formerly called &ldquo;The Grange,&rdquo; and from
this we may fairly infer that, before the Dissolution of the
Monasteries, it was a &ldquo;Grange,&rdquo; or dependency, of
Tattershall College, which owned other lands in Ashby.&nbsp; The
site was well adapted for a monastic house, as they invariably
chose a position near water, this being necessary for the supply
of fish, which formed so large a portion of their diet when
fasting days were so many.</p>
<p>Like some other parts of this parish, Holbeck also passed, at
a later period, into the ownership of Mr. Stevens Dineley Totton,
from whom Mr. John Fardell, of the Chantry, Lincoln, and formerly
M.P. for that city, purchased this manor, about 1830.&nbsp; He
took down the old <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>residence, then a farmhouse, occupied by a Mr. Hewson,
several of whose family are buried in the churchyard at Ashby,
and built Holbeck Lodge, forming also the three lakes out of an
extent of morass traversed by a brook, or beck.&nbsp; Portions of
the old stables and outhouses still remain, but an interesting
old circular dovecote <a name="citation12a"></a><a
href="#footnote12a" class="citation">[12a]</a> was removed.&nbsp;
There was, at that time, a watermill and cottage at the lower end
of the lake. <a name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a></p>
<p>The Lodge was subsequently bought by a Mr. Betts, but, through
mortgages, it became the inheritance of a Miss Cunliffe, from
whom Mr. Heywood recently bought it.&nbsp; This gentleman has
made considerable improvements and additions to the residence,
and one or two interesting discoveries have been made.&nbsp; In
sinking a well there was found, at a depth of 20ft., an old key;
also, as workmen were trying to trace a drain under the lawn, one
of them dropped into a hollow below, where arches were found,
apparently of ancient vaults. <a name="citation12c"></a><a
href="#footnote12c" class="citation">[12c]</a>&nbsp; The monks of
old knew what was meant by a good cellar, and these probably
formed a part of the original monastic institution.</p>
<p>I now proceed to a description of the church of Ashby in the
words of the late learned Precentor Venables, who gave it, on the
visit of the Architectural Society in 1894 (which I
conducted).&nbsp; &ldquo;The chancel was restored in 1869 by the
Patrons, the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln.&nbsp; The rest was
restored in 1877.&nbsp; The fabric consists of nave, north aisle
chancel, porch, and western tower, having 2 bells.&nbsp; The main
building is of the Early English style.&nbsp; A lancet window
still remains in the south wall, and at the west end of the
aisle.&nbsp; The other windows of the nave are mostly
Perpendicular.&nbsp; On the south side of the chancel is a
two-light square-headed window of the Decorated period.&nbsp; The
arcade has two chamfered arches, on low cylindrical <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>piers.&nbsp;
The tower is low, of Perpendicular style, the green sandstone,
picturesquely patched with brick, giving a mellowed tint to the
whole.&nbsp; The west doorway is well proportioned, and the
three-light Perpendicular window above it, and the tower arch are
plain, but good.&nbsp; The font is plain octagonal.&nbsp; On the
south wall is a brass to Richard Littlebury, of Stainsby, who
died <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1521, also his wife
Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edmund Jenny, died in 1523, and their
ten children. <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; Haines says that this brass was
not cut till 1560, at the same time with another of a knight in
armour, without inscription, probably one of the six sons.&nbsp;
In the pavement is a very fine incised slab of blue marble,
representing a priest in Eucharistic vestments, with chalice on
his breast.&nbsp; The head, hands, chalice, and other portions
were of brass, but have disappeared.&rdquo;&nbsp; An interesting
discovery was made in this parish rather more than 100 years ago,
a description of which I here give in the words of Saunders
(&ldquo;Hist. County Lincoln,&rdquo; vol. ii., p. 170, 1), who
gives particulars more fully than any other authority I have been
able to consult.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the 26th of October, 1794, a
labourer, cutting a ditch (the actual site is not given)
discovered at a depth of three feet below the surface a Roman
sepulchre, consisting of a stone chest, in which was deposited an
urn of strong glass, well manufactured, but of a greenish hue;
the chest was of freestone, such as is found in abundance on
Lincoln heath.&nbsp; When found the urn was perfect and had not
suffered any of that decay which generally renders the surface of
Roman glass of a pearly or opaline hue, for the surface was as
smooth as if it had newly come from the fire.&nbsp; This
receptacle was nearly filled with small pieces of bone, many of
which, from the effects of ignition, were white through their
whole substance; and among the fragments was a small lacrymatory
of very thin, and very green, glass, which had probably been
broken through the curiosity of the finder, as he acknowledged
his having poured out the contents upon the grass in the hope of
finding money, before he took it to his employer.&nbsp; The
circumstances attending this sepulchre clearly prove it to have
been Roman.&nbsp; It is, however, singular that the place chosen
was not, as was <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>customary with that people, near to a highway, and that
it does not appear to have been the burial place of a family,
since, although the trench was dug quite across the field, no
traces of a body having been buried in any other part of it were
observed. . . . No traces of the Romans have been observed here .
. . except that some coins of brass or copper were dug up in an
orchard at Stainsby, said to have been Roman, but as they were
not preserved this must remain doubtful. . . . The locality,
however, is so adapted, for various reasons, to the Roman villa,
that Sir Joseph Banks, in an article communicated to
&lsquo;Arch&aelig;ologia,&rsquo; vol. xii., p. 36, thought it
&lsquo;not improbable that such a residence might some day be
discovered, the Roman town of Banovallum being so near, with a
number of Roman roads branching through the
country.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name of Stainsby itself indicates a considerable
antiquity, meaning the stones-farm.&nbsp; This may have been from
stepping-stones over the Somersby beck, near at hand or from some
quarry of the sandstone in the vicinity, still so largely
used.&nbsp; The stones were evidently the distinguishing feature
of the locality.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;The writer is requested to say that he is in error
in connecting the family of Coltman of Ashby with that of the
Pocklington Coltman of Hagnaby, the two being quite distinct.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Asterby</span>.</h3>
<p>Asterby is situated about 6&frac12; miles from Horncastle in a
north-easterly direction, being approached by the road to
Scamblesby and Louth, but diverging from that road northward
shortly before reaching Scamblesby.&nbsp; The Rector is the Rev.
J. Graham, J.P., who has a substantial residence, erected at a
cost of &pound;1,200 in 1863, and standing on the slope of a hill
in good grounds.&nbsp; Letters, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Lincoln, arrive
at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Not much can be gathered of the early history of this
parish.&nbsp; It is named in <i>Domesday Book</i> Estreby; this
may mean the &ldquo;buy,&rdquo; byre, or farmstead, of the Saxon
Thane Estori.&nbsp; But, according to another interpretation, the
three elements of the name are As, or Aes, tre and by; <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the first of
these implying &ldquo;water,&rdquo; the second &ldquo;a
way&rdquo; or &ldquo;passage,&rdquo; the third a
&ldquo;homestead,&rdquo; the whole thus meaning the Homestead by
the water-way; and so probably referring to the river Bain, which
forms the boundary between this parish and Ranby; its breed of
trout being not unknown to anglers of our own day.</p>
<p>According to the Domesday survey this manor belonged to the
Norman noble Ivo Taillebois, doubtless through his marriage with
the Saxon heiress of the Thorolds, the Lady Lucia.&nbsp; And she
conveyed to the Priory of Spalding certain
&ldquo;temporalities,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, rents of lands, here,
as well as at Scamblesby; her uncle Thorold, Vice-Comes, or
Sheriff, of Lincolnshire, being the founder of that institution,
and she herself one of its chief benefactors.&nbsp; In the Priory
Charters this parish is also called Esterby.</p>
<p>Ivo, however, was only this lady&rsquo;s first husband, and,
as is mentioned in the &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; on various other
parishes with which he was connected, he died without issue; and
on her re-marrying, <a name="citation15a"></a><a
href="#footnote15a" class="citation">[15a]</a> her great
possessions passed to the Romara family, subsequently to the
Gaunts, and were then gradually broken up, and dispersed among
their various descendants.&nbsp; Only a few fragmentary records
of former owners can now be found.</p>
<p>By Will dated 31st July, 1585, Edmund Dighton, of Little
Sturton, leaves lands in Asterby and elsewhere to his son Robert,
and also his leases of land held by grant of the late Abbot of
Kirkstead, and a house called Beadway Hall.&nbsp; The
Dighton&rsquo;s were a wealthy family, originally engaged in
commerce in Lincoln, but afterwards acquiring considerable
property in various parts of the county, and taking a good
position.&nbsp; The headquarters of the family were at the Old
Hall, of which traces still remain, in Little Stourton; a
daughter of Thomas Dighton &ldquo;of that ilk&rdquo; married
Edward, 2nd son of the 1st Earl of Lincoln, of that line, temp.
Elizabeth; she eventually, on the death of his eldest brother,
becoming Countess of Lincoln. <a name="citation15b"></a><a
href="#footnote15b" class="citation">[15b]</a></p>
<p>Elizabeth Hansard, of Gayton-le-Wold, widow, by her Will,
dated 17th March, 1591, makes her father, John Jackson, of
Asterby, executor, and the guardian of her children, Edward,
Margaret, and Mary Hansard; and leaves all her property to them,
except 20s. each to her <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>brother Thomas Jackson, and her
brother-in-law William Hansard.&nbsp; These Hansards, a knightly
family located in this county at South Kelsey (also of Beesthorpe
and Thornton), were of very old extraction; tracing their descent
from Ughtred, Earl of Northumberland in the reign of Edmund
Ironsides, who came to the throne <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 016. <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; South Kelsey,
their chief seat, passed to the old family of the Ayscoughs, by
the marriage of Sir Francis Ayscough to the Hansard heiress,
Elizabeth, in the middle of the 16th century.&nbsp; Both Hansards
and Ayscoughs were connected with many of the leading county
families.</p>
<p>John Guevera, of Stenigot, by Will dated 18th March, 1607,
leaves his manor of Stenigot and all his premises in Asterby
(certain portions being excepted) to his &ldquo;Sonne Francis,
his heir apparent, on his coming of age,&rdquo; and specifies
that &ldquo;till then he be held content by Sir Nicholas
Saunderson, knight, of Fillingham, and Captaine Henrie Guevera,
of Barwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; These Gueveras were of Spanish origin,
probably coming to England in the train of Catharine of Arragon,
or in attendance on King Philip of Spain, Queen Mary&rsquo;s
husband.&nbsp; Spain was then a flourishing country, and they
soon acquired property, and took their position among the landed
gentry, Francis Guevera being named among the Herald&rsquo;s List
of Gentry in 1634.&nbsp; Sir Nicholas Saunderson, here named, of
Fillingham, was grandson of Nicholas Saunderson, of Reasby, in
the parish of Stainton-by-Langworth.&nbsp; He was made a baronet
in 1612, and Viscount Castleton in 1628.&nbsp; The family was
involved in the Lincolnshire Rebellion of 1536.&nbsp; The manor,
and greater part of the parish, are now in the hands of trustees
of the Trafford family, who are also patrons of the
benefice.&nbsp; Messrs. W. Pinning and Benjamin Harrison are also
landowners, and Mr. James Walter has a large and picturesque
farmhouse with good grounds and surroundings.</p>
<p>The church, dedicated to St. Peter, was for some years in an
unsatisfactory condition, but during recent years it has been
gradually undergoing restoration.&nbsp; It was formerly larger
than it is now, having had a north aisle.&nbsp; The tower was
half taken down towards the close of the 18th century, and
rebuilt, the plinth of the tower buttress on the south side of
the west door being said to be the original one of the <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>12th
century.&nbsp; There are three bells.&nbsp; In 1896 the chancel
was taken down and extended about 6ft. in length, the interior
face of the walls being constructed of rubbed sandstone, in
courses obtained from a quarry in the parish.&nbsp; The exterior
character of the old work was carefully preserved, and a dressed
stone plinth-course inserted.&nbsp; The old east window with
wooden framework was removed and a stone traceried window
introduced, filled with tinted glass.&nbsp; The floor was paved
with encaustic tiles in place of ordinary bricks, and the
communion table raised 18 inches above the body of the church, by
three steps.&nbsp; A new altar rail of oak, with standard of
wrought-iron and brass, was put up, and the roof was made of open
timbers covered with match boards and slates.&nbsp; This work was
done by Mr. R. Mawer, builder, of Louth, under the direction of
Messrs. Mortimer and Son, architects, of Lincoln.&nbsp; The
entire cost was defrayed by the present rector.&nbsp; Since then
other improvements have been effected.&nbsp; The tower, in a
dangerous condition, was partly taken down in 1898, and the bells
rehung in new oak framework.&nbsp; A handsome altar cloth was
presented by Lady Wigan.&nbsp; The nave floor has now boards in
place of the old damp and unsightly bricks.&nbsp; It has been
supplied with new seating of pitchpine.&nbsp; This work was
entrusted to Messrs. Thompson &amp; Sons, of Louth, and is
thoroughly satisfactory.&nbsp; Inspired by these efforts, a
generous donor, Mrs. Woodall, presented a massive oak lectern in
memory of her parents who for many years worshipped in this
church, and the whole fabric is now at length, through the
exertions of the rector, liberally seconded by Mrs. Graham, a
credit to the parish.&nbsp; Old features of interest in the
church are the chancel arch, which is Early English; and in the
south chancel wall, near the reading desk, is also a three-light
Early English window, containing some fragments of very old
glass, the new east window being a copy of this.&nbsp; In the
north wall of the nave are two bays of the former aisle blocked
up, with a grinning figurehead between the arches.&nbsp; In a
frame affixed to the north wall is the text, from Eccl. v., 1,
&ldquo;Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be
more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of
fools.&rdquo;&nbsp; The font is old, having an octagonal bowl,
with plain shields on each face, the shaft also being <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>octagonal and
standing on a pediment of three steps.&nbsp; In the south wall of
the chancel, outside, is a mutilated slab bearing an inscription
in memory of &ldquo;Samson Meanwell, who departed this life Feb.
17, 1744, in ye 63 yeare of his age.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nearly opposite
the west door is a very old yew-tree, which may well have
supplied the village archers with their bows in the days of
Crecy, Poictiers, and Agincourt.&nbsp; The benefice is now held
jointly with that of Goulceby.&nbsp; It was formerly in the gift
of the Dymokes.&nbsp; Dame Jane Dymoke presented in 1711 and
1725.&nbsp; She also gave church plate.&nbsp; The patronage then
passed to the Crown, who presented in 1771 and 1784, after which
the Trafford Southwell family acquired it, with the manor, and
presented in 1807.</p>
<p>Near the church is a field named Hall Close, where there are
traces of a large residence; and here, about the year 1821, were
dug up three human skeletons and an ancient dagger.</p>
<p>The poor of the parish have the benefit of a bequest made by
Anthony Acham, for them, and for those of Goulceby; who also, in
1638, founded a school for the two parishes, with Stenigot.</p>
<p>We have only to add that the pilgrim to Asterby, who has an
eye for rural scenery, will be gratified on his way thither by an
extent of view not often to be found.&nbsp; He can take in, at
one and the same moment, a prospect reaching almost 30 miles,
including Lincoln Cathedral and miles beyond it to the
north-west; and embracing Heckington and other fine church
spires, with Tattershall Castle to the south-west, and extensive
woods, corn fields, and meads to vary the scenes between.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Baumber</span>.</h3>
<p>Baumber, or Bamburgh, lies on the old Roman road, from
Horncastle to Lincoln, about 4 miles to the north-west from the
former place, and half-a-mile from the point where another Roman
road furcates northward for Caistor; it is thus somewhat
interestingly connected with the three ancient Roman stations,
Lindum, Banovallum, and Caistor (Castrum).&nbsp; Its own name, in
the older form, Bam-burg doubtless means the &ldquo;Burg,&rdquo;
or fort, on the Bain; as it <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>stands on high ground above the
valley of the Bain, and commands what would formerly be a ford of
that river at Hemingby, through which there passes a branch line
of road, running due east from Baumber, and stretching into the
wold hills, being doubtless also a Roman structure.</p>
<p>Baumber has had some interesting associations in the
past.&nbsp; In Domesday Book it is reckoned among the possessions
of the Norman Ivo Tayle-bois, nephew of William the Conqueror,
Earl of Anjou, and chief of the Angevin auxiliaries of
William&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; Through his wife, the Lady Lucia, the
Saxon heiress of Earl Alf-gar, who was given to him in marriage
by the Conqueror, he acquired very large possessions in
Lincolnshire and elsewhere.&nbsp; He was of a very tyrannical
disposition; his chief residence being near Croyland Abbey.&nbsp;
The Historian Ingulphus records of him, that he &ldquo;tortured,
harrassed, annoyed, and imprisoned their people&rdquo;; that
&ldquo;he chased their cattle with his dogs, driving them into
the marsh pools, where they were drowned; cut off their ears, or
their tails; broke their backs, or their legs; and made them
useless.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the world was relieved of him by an
early death, he was not mourned by his Saxon wife, or anyone
else.&nbsp; Another historian, Peter de Blois, says,
&ldquo;Hardly had one month elapsed after his death, when the
Lady Lucia married that illustrious young man, Roger de Romara,
and entirely lost all recollection of Ivo Tayle-bois&rdquo;; and
he bursts into a volley of imprecations, to this
effect:&mdash;&ldquo;What does it now profit thee, O Ivo! ever
most blood-thirsty, thus to have risen against the Lord?&nbsp;
Unto the earth hast thou fallen, numbered with the dead; in a
moment of time thou hast descended to hell, a successor of the
old Adam, a frail potsherd, a heap of ashes, a hide of carrion, a
vessel of putrefaction, the food of worms, the laughing-stock of
those who survive, the refuse of the inhabitants of heaven, the
avowed enemy of the servants of God; and now, as we have reason
to suppose, an alien and exile from the congregations of saints,
and for thine innumerable misdeeds, worthy to be sent into outer
darkness.&rdquo; <a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a></p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Such
was one of the proprietors of Baumber, but he was not the only
one; as Domesday mentions another, and larger, and more worthy,
land owner in the person of Gilbert de Gaunt, who succeeded,
&ldquo;by right,&rdquo; or, more strictly speaking, by
confiscation, to all the property of the Saxon Tonna; while
another Saxon, Ulf, had also an estate in the parish.&nbsp; This
Gilbert de Gaunt founded Bardney Abbey; and, when he died, was
buried there.</p>
<p>The Lady Lucia was Countess of Chester and Lincoln; and at a
later period, Baumber, including the hamlet of Sturton Parva,
would seem to have been mainly divided between the family of the
Earls of Lincoln, more recently created Dukes of Newcastle, and
the wealthy family of the Dightons.&nbsp; Both had residences in
or near this parish.&nbsp; A daughter of Thomas Dighton, and his
heiress married Edward Clinton, second son of the first Earl of
Lincoln of that line (temp. Elizabeth), and on failure of issue
to the elder brother, this Edward succeeded to the Earldom.&nbsp;
Many generations of the Clintons were buried here; but towards
the end of the 18th century, the Clinton property was sold by the
third Duke to Mr. Thomas Livesey, of Blackburn, Lancashire, <a
name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a> whose son, the late Joseph Livesey,
Esq. erected a large mansion in 1810, which again was almost
rebuilt, and considerably enlarged in 1873&ndash;5.&nbsp; A large
part of the parish now belongs to the Vyner family of
Gautby.&nbsp; The Baumber register dates from 1691.&nbsp; One
entry is &ldquo;June 20th, 1730, the Corpse of the Right
Honourable, the Right Noble, Lord George Clinton, Earl of
Lincoln, was interred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Church is dedicated to St. Swithun.&nbsp; The west door is
a good specimen of Norman work, with dog-tooth pattern running
round the semi-circular arch, in bass relief; the capital of its
south pillar has a head, with serpents whispering into each
ear.&nbsp; The north capital is a conventional acanthus.&nbsp;
The inner eastern door of the tower is also Norman, but
plain.&nbsp; The Nave has north and south aisles of three bays;
the eastern-most column of the north arcade, under the removable
flooring of the Vicar&rsquo;s seat, has the original round Norman
plinth, the only one preserved.&nbsp; The Church of stone was
cased in brick, in the early part of the eighteenth century
(1736), when <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>the present large, perpendicular windows were placed in
the north and south walls, three in each.&nbsp; Placed against
the west wall, south of the west entrance, is a large slab,
commemorating John Ealand, who died in 1463, and his wives Alice
and Elizabeth.&nbsp; This was formerly in the floor of the north
aisle.&nbsp; Above is a tablet in memory of members of the family
of J. Bainbridge Smith, D.D., formerly Vicar, as well as Rector
of Sotby, and of Martin, and Headmaster of the Horncastle Grammar
School.&nbsp; The Font is octagonal and massive, but plain.&nbsp;
There is a handsome oak lectern with eagle on swivels, the gift
of Mrs. Taylor Sharpe, of Baumber Park, in memory of her eldest
son, who died in 1891.&nbsp; The pose of the eagle is very
natural.</p>
<p>In the south aisle, and over the west entrance are hatchments
of the Clintons.</p>
<p>In the chancel, the east window is blocked up; there are two
windows in the north wall, one in the south wall, the second
having been removed when a vestry was erected, and it now forms
the vestry window.&nbsp; On each side, east of the chancel arch,
are remains of massive early English pillars.&nbsp; South of
communion table are three plain sedilia of wood.&nbsp; North of
the table, a blue slate slab in the floor, with the Clinton arms,
covers the vault, in which sixteen of the Clinton family are
interred.&nbsp; Another slab close by, commemorates
&ldquo;Francis Clinton, alias Fynes, Esq., grandson of Henry Lord
Clinton, Earl of Lincoln, who departed this life, February 5th,
<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1681.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the
south, a slab commemorates his wife, &ldquo;who died, February
15th, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1679.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
communion chair, of very solid construction, was carved out of a
beam formerly in Tattershall Castle.&nbsp; There are some remains
of a former rood screen, &ldquo;Arch. Journ.,&rdquo; 1890, p.
206.</p>
<p>Mr. Weir, in his History of Lincolnshire (vol. I., p. 299,
Ed., 1828), says that portions of the former residence of the
Earls of Lincoln were at that date still standing, near the
modern mansion of the Liveseys.&nbsp; Then the latter was
re-constructed in 1873&ndash;5, the furniture and other
arrangements, were of a very costly character.&nbsp; The present
writer, with an acquaintance of the family, had the privilege of
being shewn over the whole house, by the lady of the house,
shortly after its completion.&nbsp; It might be called a
repertoire of valuable works of art and vertu, in furniture,
books, paintings, stuffed birds, and animals, <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>among the
latter being the famous lion &ldquo;Nero,&rdquo; from the
Zoo.&nbsp; The owner, being devoted to engineering and mechanical
operations, had one room, of which the walls were covered with
clocks, of endless kinds, with various elaborate mechanism, such
as cocks crowing, horns blowing, etc., etc., for chiming the
hours.&nbsp; All these came to the hammer in 1891.&nbsp; Even the
economy of the farm yard was elaborate.&nbsp; To give one
instance:&mdash;At the back of the cattle sheds, ran a tramway of
small trucks; doors opened at the back of the crib of each stall,
and the trucks conveyed the exact modicum of provender, and it
was injected into each separate crib, periodically, for the
animals which were there fed.&nbsp; The lake in the park was
formed from a small stream running through the grounds, it is
well stocked with fish of various kinds, especially affording
sport to the troller by the abundance of fine pike.&nbsp; It was
originally stocked, as tradition avers, from the Moat of Langton
Rectory, now no longer existing, but formerly of considerable
size, and connected with a large pond, where fish of many kinds
abounded.&nbsp; The vicarage is a substantial residence, with
good garden, erected in 1857, on a site presented by Robert
Vyner, Esq.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Belchford</span>.</h3>
<p>Belchford is one of our largest villages, lying at a distance
of about 5 miles from Horncastle, in a north-east direction, and
buried in a valley among the wolds.&nbsp; It was anciently among
the possessions of the Conqueror&rsquo;s nephew, Ivo Tailebois,
which he acquired by his marriage with the Lady Lucia, the
wealthy heiress of the Thorolds.&nbsp; Tithes and territory here
were assigned by her to the Abbey of Croyland, as well as to its
cell, the branch Priory of Spalding.&nbsp; There were two mills
here, valued in Domesday book, at 18s. 8d. yearly.&nbsp; The
acreage is large; Ivo had five carucates in demesne, or some 600
acres, while villeins, bordars, and soc-men, occupied nine
carucates, or about 1080 acres; there were 360 acres of meadows,
and six carucates (720 acres) reateable to gelt.&nbsp; The arable
land was a mile long, and a mile broad, which was a large
proportion.&nbsp; The acreage is now 2480, the population <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>more than
400.&nbsp; By an indenture, 28th October, 1641, we find Sir
Thomas Glemham owning lands in Belchford and Oxcombe, as well as
other places, which he sold to Sir Matthew Lister, and his
brother Martin Lister, subsequently the Listers of Burwell
Park.&nbsp; The Listers, however, sold the Belchford lands again
to Sir Thomas Hartopp, about 20 years later.&nbsp; Mr. Robert
Charles de Grey Vyner is now Lord of the Manor, but much of the
land belongs to the Epton, Reed, and other families.&nbsp; At the
inclosure, land left by Henry Neave to the poor, was exchanged
for two acres, now let for &pound;5 15s., which is distributed
among the poor at Christmas, as well as a rent charge of 4s.,
left by Mrs. Douglas Tyrwhitt.&nbsp; Letters, <i>via</i>
Horncastle, arrive at 9.30 a.m.&nbsp; The nearest telegraph
office is at Tetford.</p>
<p>Of the church of St. Peter and St. Paul, little can be said
which is satisfactory, at the present time.&nbsp; It was rebuilt
in 1781, in the characteristic poor style of that period.&nbsp;
Some years ago it became almost unsafe, and the walls were
strengthened to prevent their falling.&nbsp; The chancel was
rebuilt in 1859&ndash;60; and in 1884&ndash;5, the church was
reseated, the plaster ceiling removed, a new floor supplied, and
fresh windows inserted; but once more it is in a bad and
unsightly condition, gaps and fissures appear in the walls, the
tower is much out of the perpendicular, and only kept together by
bands of iron.&nbsp; The north wall is only relieved by one very
plain Georgian window.&nbsp; The east window, a triplet in the
early English style, is perhaps the best feature in the
church.&nbsp; It was put in by a former Rector, Rev. W. Anthony
Fitzhugh.&nbsp; The font, which is octagonal and perpendicular,
formerly stood in St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, Horncastle.&nbsp; The
pulpit, of old oak, came from the private chapel of Lord
Brougham, who was a relative of the late Rector; it has some
quaintly-carved panels, and other portions in the same style lie
unused in the church.&nbsp; The baptismal register has an entry
of a baptism performed by Dr. Tennyson, father of the Poet
Laureate.&nbsp; The register dates from 1698.</p>
<p>Some embellishments have been introduced in the chancel of
late by the present Rector.&nbsp; An Italian crucifix, behind the
Communion table, with devices representing the keys of St. Peter,
and sword of St. Paul, the patron saints, with vine leaves and
grapes, and a central chalice.&nbsp; There is a scroll below
these, bearing the words, &ldquo;Ecce panis <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Angelorum
Factus cibus Viatorum.&rdquo;&nbsp; The church ornaments include
a processional cross of 18th century foreign work.&nbsp; An
effort is now being made to accomplish a thorough restoration of
the church.&nbsp; A flint implement was found in the parish in
the year 1851, and fossils of the Echinus and other kinds have
been found.&nbsp; The name of Belchford may be British; Bel
(Baal) being the Druid name of the Sun-God and
&ldquo;fford,&rdquo; is Welsh (or British), for road; a more
pleasing, if more fanciful, derivation, has been suggested, viz.:
that the prefix is connected with the words &ldquo;bellow&rdquo;
and &ldquo;bell,&rdquo; and refers to the tinkling music of the
ford on the brook, which passes through the valley.</p>
<p>In an ancient register of Spalding Priory, of date 1659, is an
extract from a charter of the foundation of the Priory, in which
it is stated that one Thorold, ancestor of Lucia, Countess of
Lincoln and Chester, and wife of Ivo Tailebois, gave the Tithes
of Belchford, Scamblesby, etc., to the Priory.&nbsp; The name is
there spelt Beltisford, which would seem to favour the former of
these two derivations.&nbsp; In Domesday Book it is Beltisford,
further confirmatory of the same.</p>
<p>A former Rector of this Benefice was somewhat of a
&ldquo;character.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a <i>bon vivant</i>, though
not of an objectionable kind.&nbsp; He was popular among his
clerical brethren, and, like several others, gave an annual
clerical dinner, which was attended by them from considerable
distances.&nbsp; One of the special features of the repast, was a
leg of mutton, with port wine sauce, which, as well as the wine,
might be said to be &ldquo;old.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cellars of the
rectory were very cool, and he usually had a leg which had been
hanging for a quarter of a year, half a year, or more.&nbsp; At
one of the last of his dinners, the joint had been in the cellar,
specially preserved, for more than twelve months, but, served as
it was, with a good surrounding, it was unanimously declared to
be excellent.</p>
<p>The Rev. Egremont Richardson was long remembered by many
friends, for his kindly, genial qualities.</p>
<p>Since the above remarks on the church were written, the fabric
has, in a great measure, been worthily restored.&nbsp; The
architect, Mr. Townsend, of Peterborough, employed Messrs.
Thompson, of Peterborough (who have restored Peterborough
Cathedral), and they have done the work thoroughly.&nbsp; The
tower, in a dangerous condition, has been taken down, and will
not be rebuilt until funds allow it, <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>but otherwise the restoration is
complete.&nbsp; Five decorated windows have been introduced into
the former dark walls, a vestry has been added, and the walls of
the nave have been beautifully decorated.&nbsp; The chancel walls
are relieved with terra cotta, of the 17th century style, the
roof having black and white arrow-head work.&nbsp; The choir
stalls are stained green, and decorated in harmony with the
walls.&nbsp; There is a new altar-table of oak, its panels being
richly painted.&nbsp; The nave is furnished with chairs, in place
of the old pews.&nbsp; The church is heated with the Radiator
system, on the Italian principle, supplied by Messrs. J. Ward
&amp; Co., of Horncastle, being the first church in the
neighbourhood furnished with this apparatus.&nbsp; In the porch
is preserved a relic of the past, an old stoup, or holy water
vessel, found in the Churchwarden&rsquo;s yard.&nbsp; This has
been done at a cost of about &pound;900, and a further sum of
&pound;700 or &pound;800 will be needed to restore the
tower.&nbsp; The chief donors to the work have been the Rawnsley
family, and Lord Heneage.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Bolingbroke</span>, <span
class="smcap">Old</span>.</h3>
<p>Bolingbroke, to which is now added the epithet
&ldquo;old,&rdquo; to distinguish it from the modern creation,
New Bolingbroke, near Revesby, lies distant about seven miles, in
an easterly direction from Horncastle, and about four miles
westward from Spilsby, in a kind of <i>cul-de-sac</i>, formed by
steep hills on three sides.&nbsp; As to the meaning of the name,
whether its commonly accepted derivation from the brook, the
spring-head of which, as Camden says (Britannia, p. 471), is in
low ground hard by, be correct, we must leave to full-fledged
etymologists to decide; but the small streamlet, as it exists at
present, in no way answers to the ideal of a bowling brook,
sufficient to be a distinguishing feature of the place.&nbsp; We
would venture to suggest, as a fair subject for their enquiry,
that, as &ldquo;bullen&rdquo; is Danish for
&ldquo;swollen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;brock&rdquo; is only another
form of &ldquo;burgh&rdquo; (and common enough in Scotland),
meaning a fort (as we have a few miles away, near Hallington
station, <i>Bully</i>-hill, near an ancient encampment), there
may have been an older fort, swelling out like an excrescence at
the mouth of this valley; and so a &ldquo;bollen&rdquo; (or
bulging) <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&ldquo;broc,&rdquo; providing a fitting site on which
the later castle was also erected.&nbsp; It might, too, seem some
confirmation of this, that, in Domesday Book, the name is given
as Bolin broc.&nbsp; Be this as it may, however, the place itself
is one of unusual interest to the arch&aelig;ologist.&nbsp; It is
a town in decadence.&nbsp; Possessed of a market-place, and a
number of good houses, some paved streets, a fine church, the
site of a castle, and that rare distinction an
&ldquo;Honour,&rdquo; it is yet but a village, with little to
stir its &ldquo;sleepy hollow&rdquo; into social life or
animation.&nbsp; The visitor may, perhaps, meet there (as the
writer has done), one who has retired from her Majesty&rsquo;s
service; who has weilded his cutlass on quarterdeck, or carried
his rifle through stockade or over battlement; the said
individual may long, on the settle by the snug hostel fire, to
fight his battles over again, in converse with some kindred
spirit; but there is now no tread of sentinel on castle-wall, no
warder now blows his bugle at castle gate.&nbsp; The castle
itself is but a phantom of the past, only to be now seen in
imagination.&nbsp; He would, perhaps, fain know something of its
bygone history; but he finds no one to tell it.&nbsp; Ichabod
echoes through the silent streets, and he can only murmur in the
words of an ancient lament (for, is it not written in the book of
Jasher?) &ldquo;How are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war
perished.&rdquo;&nbsp; The County Directory tells him (as would
also Domesday Book) that Bolingbroke had a weekly market <a
name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a>; from a like authority he may learn
that the soke, or Honour, of Bolingbroke embraced nearly 30
parishes, Spilsby amongst them. <a name="citation26b"></a><a
href="#footnote26b" class="citation">[26b]</a>&nbsp; Yet he goes
to Spilsby on a Monday and finds it crowded with traffickers,
while, from week&rsquo;s end to week&rsquo;s end, the market
place of Bolingbroke does not see a merchant or a huckster.&nbsp;
Sooth to say, the secluded nature of the locality, which of old
commended it as a fitting position for a strongly-protected
castle, embedded in hills, save on one side, served really to
isolate it from the outer world, and hindred, and ultimately <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>destroyed,
the traffic, which became gradually transferred to other towns
more easy of access.&nbsp; And so the once busy market is grass
grown, and the buzz of its barter would not awaken a baby.&nbsp;
The sole sound, indeed, of any volume, to break the moribund
monotony&mdash;and this only one of recent creation&mdash;is the
peal of fine bells with which the church is now furnished, and
instead of soliloquising further we will now proceed to describe
these, and then unfold the fine features of the church, of which
they form so melodious an appurtenance.&nbsp; There are six
larger bells and the old sanctus bell.&nbsp; Of the larger bells,
one is old, and five were presented in 1897, by Miss Maria
Wingate, whose family, formerly resided at Hareby House, which
small parish and benefice were annexed to Bolingbroke in 1739. <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a>&nbsp; The five new bells were cast by
Messrs. Taylor, of Loughborough, a well-known firm of
bell-founders.&nbsp; These were consecrated by Bishop King, of
Lincoln, soon after they were hung.&nbsp; On one of them, the
treble bell, is the inscription, &ldquo;God save the Queen, a
thank-offering in commemoration of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s
Jubilee, 1897.&rdquo;&nbsp; The peculiar appropriateness of this
inscription will be the more manifest, when the singular fact is
remembered (as will be fully explained hereafter), that, as
Duchess of Lancaster, the Queen was Lady of the Manor of
Bolingbroke.&nbsp; The old bell bears the date 1604, and has the
inscription&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I, sweetly tolling, men do call,<br />
To taste our meats that feede the soole.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This old bell is a very fine one, and is named among the
&ldquo;Bells of Lincolnshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the church itself, dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul, it
may be said that it has had its peculiar vicissitudes.&nbsp; It
was built probably by John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster; as the
flamboyant style of its architecture indicates a late 14th
century erection; and he was granted the manor in that century
(1363).&nbsp; Many of our finest churches, such as those of
Boston, Grantham, Heckington, &amp;c., were built in that
century.&nbsp; This of Bolingbroke is one of the latest of them,
corresponding most closely in style and date to the Church of
Kyme Priory; but it is certainly not one of the least
striking.&nbsp; We now see in it only a portion of the original,
namely, the south aisle, porch, <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>and tower.&nbsp; It was occupied as
head quarters by the Parliamentary troops in 1643, while they
were laying siege to the castle, which was held for the King;
and, with their usual puritan hatred of holy places, they
destroyed the beautiful stained glass which adorned the windows;
while, further, their presence there drew upon the building heavy
bombardment by the King&rsquo;s men, no less destructive to the
edifice itself.&nbsp; Since that time, the original south aisle
has been used as the main body of the church; and until recently,
the arches of the arcade, formerly dividing it from the original
nave, were distinctly visible, built up in the (later) north
wall; while the tower, originally standing at the west end of the
nave, became (in consequence of the destruction of the latter,
semi-detached from the later south aisle) church, at its
north-west angle.&nbsp; The church was restored in 1889, through
the munificence of Mr. C. S. Dickinson, of Lincoln, at a cost of
&pound;3,000; the architect being the late Mr. James Fowler; and
it was re-opened by the Bishop on Oct. 10th of that year; the old
disfiguring galleries having been removed, and new battlements
and pinnacles being added to the tower; and a new north aisle
being erected, extending eastward from the tower; the original
south aisle being still retained as a modern nave, re-seated, and
re-furnished in every respect; and a new organ added, with
various improvements.&nbsp; As to the result, we cannot do better
than quote some of the observations of the late Precentor
Venables, made by him on the visit of the Lincolnshire
Architectural Society in 1894. <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a>&nbsp; He described
it as &ldquo;a building of great stateliness, the proportions
being excellent, and in its general design and architectural
details, presenting a specimen of the decorated style in its
greatest purity and beauty; the windows are almost faultless
examples of flowing tracery in its early purity.&nbsp; The east
window has five lights, with quatrefoil window in the gable
above; the west window four lights; and the side windows three
lights each; all excellent.&nbsp; The south porch has a
well-proportioned inner door with good moulding; there being an
open quatrefoil over the door.&nbsp; In its east corner there is
a very sumptuous holy water stoup of unusual design, surmounted
by a tall canopy of great richness.&nbsp; There is a statue <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>bracket over
the door, and one at the side.&nbsp; The recently opened arcade
on the north side of nave is composed of fine equilateral arches,
with mouldings continuous from their bases, without the
intervention of capitals.&nbsp; On the south wall of the present
chancel is a range of three rich, though rather heavy, stone
sedilia, with projecting canopies over-braided with wall-flowers,
and groined within Traces of canopied niches of similar design to
the sedilia, are visible on each side of the east window.&nbsp;
The piscina, with projecting basin, is plain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the middle of the south wall of the nave there is also an
old piscina, with aumbrey above it, which would indicate that, in
the original church, there was here a chantry. <a
name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a>&nbsp; The present pulpit, and the choir
seats in the chancel, are of modern oak richly carved; and the
vestry, at the back of the organ, is screened off by similar rich
modern oak carving.&nbsp; The tower has a west door, with a
four-light window over it; a two-light window above this, with
corresponding ones in the north and south faces.&nbsp; Within the
tower, over an ancient fireplace, is embedded in the wall, 4ft.
from the ground, a curious old gurgoyle head of peculiar
hideousness, which doubtless, at one time, grinned down from the
original roof.&nbsp; Over the said fireplace there is this
inscription graven in a stone:&mdash;&ldquo;Sixpence in bread
every Sunday for ever for the poore women present at divine
service, given by John Andred, M.A., rector of Bolingbroke, Anno
Domini MDCLXXX.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the churchyard is a tall monument, surmounted by a cherub
with expanded wings, in memory of Edward Stanley Bosanquet, who
died July 16th, 1886, formerly vicar; also of his wife Emmeline,
and three children, who died at different dates.&nbsp; Outside
the north wall are some stone ends of seats, formerly in the
tower.</p>
<p>It may here be worthy of remark that Chancellor Massingberd,
in his account of the battle of Winceby mentions that
&ldquo;among the slain on the side of the King was a Lincolnshire
gentleman of the name of Hallam, the immediate ancestor of the
Historian of the Middle Ages,&rdquo; Henry Hallam.&nbsp; The name
is not a common one; and on a broken stone slab, lying behind the
N.E. buttress, under <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>the N.E. window, is the fragmentary
inscription, &ldquo;Body of Henry Hallam, who dyed January The 6,
1687.&rdquo; <a name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a></p>
<p>We conclude our notice of this church with the words of the
Precentor:&mdash;&ldquo;We may realize the magnitude, and the
beauty of the (former) entire church, when we bear in mind that,
besides what we now see, there was a wide nave, a north aisle,
doubtless equal in dimensions and style to that now standing, and
a long chancel reaching to the limits of the
churchyard.&rdquo;&nbsp; A building so fine would attest the
former importance of the place; and we now proceed to consider
other proofs of that importance which we know to have
existed.</p>
<p>Bolingbroke is, indeed, a place of no mushroom growth.&nbsp;
The Castle was built in the reign of Henry I. by William de
Romara, Earl of Lincoln, who also founded the Abbey of Revesby
about 1143.&nbsp; But history carries us back to a still earlier
date, and to an older, and even more interesting, and more
important family than that of Romara.&nbsp; The mother of William
de Romara (or, according to others, his grandmother) was Lucia, a
Saxon heiress <a name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a>; sister of the powerful Morcar, Earl
of Northumberland, who for some time withstood the Conqueror, and
daughter of Algar, Earl of Mercia, who was the brother of Edgiva,
King Harold&rsquo;s Queen (others making Edgiva the sister of
Lucia).&nbsp; She was also a near relative of the renowned
&ldquo;Hereward the Wake,&rdquo; the stubborn champion of Saxon
freedom.&nbsp; There was an earlier Algar, Earl of Mercia, who,
200 years before, fell in the famous fight of Threckingham
(between Sleaford and Folkingham) against the Danes, about <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 865.&nbsp; He was the son of another
Algar, and grandson of Leofric, both successively Earls of
Mercia; the wife of the last-named being the Lady Godiva (or
God&rsquo;s gift, &ldquo;Deodata&rdquo;), renowned for her purity
and good works.&nbsp; This Lady Godiva was the sister of Turold,
or Thorold, of Bukenale (Bucknall), <a name="citation30c"></a><a
href="#footnote30c" class="citation">[30c]</a> <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Lord of
Spalding, and Vice-Count, or Sheriff of the County of
Lincoln.&nbsp; And these Thorolds, father and son, were among the
chief benefactors of the famous Monastery of St. Guthlac, at
Croyland; a similar good work being also performed, in her own
day, by the aforesaid Lady Lucia, who was chief patroness of the
Priory of Spalding <a name="citation31a"></a><a
href="#footnote31a" class="citation">[31a]</a> an offshoot of the
greater Croyland Abbey.&nbsp; Thus William of Romara was not only
a Norman &ldquo;of high degree,&rdquo; on his father&rsquo;s
side, but, through his mother, he came of a race of Saxons,
powerful, brave, and distinguished for their services to their
country and religion.&nbsp; It has been frequently observed that,
although the Normans conquered and subjugated Saxon England, the
stubborn Saxon eventually absorbed, or prevailed over, his Norman
master; and we have an illustration of it here, not uninteresting
to men of Lincolnshire.&nbsp; The name of Romara has long been
gone, in our country and elsewhere, beyond recall; but the old
Saxon name of Thorold yet stands high in the roll of our county
families.&nbsp; There is probably no older name in the shire;
none that has so completely maintained its good position and
succession, in unbroken descent. <a name="citation31b"></a><a
href="#footnote31b" class="citation">[31b]</a></p>
<p>Now the Lady Lucia inherited many of the lands of her Saxon
ancestors; and among those which passed to her Son William of
Romara, was Bolingbroke.&nbsp; He was a man of many, and wide
domains, but of them all he selected this, as the place for
erecting a stronghold, capable of defence in those troublous
times.&nbsp; The castle is described by Holles (temp. Charles I)
as &ldquo;surrounded by a moat fed by streams, and as covering
about an acre and half; built in a square, with four strong
forts,&rdquo; probably at the corners; and &ldquo;containing many
rooms, which were connected by passages along the embattled walls
and capable to receyve a very great prince with all his
trayne.&rdquo;&nbsp; The entrance was &ldquo;very stately, over a
fair draw bridge; the gate-house uniforme, and
strong.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gateway, of which the crumbling ruins
were engraved by Stukeley in the first half of the l8th century,
finally fell in 1815; and nothing now remains <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>above
ground.&nbsp; The whole structure was of the sandstone of the
neighbourhood, which, as Holles observes, will crumble away when
the wet once penetrates it.&nbsp; The moat is still visible; and
further, in the rear of it, to the south, beyond the immediate
precincts, there is another moated enclosure, still to be seen,
the residence doubtless of dependants under the shelter of the
castle; or these may have been earthworks excavated by the forces
besieging the castle.&nbsp; We cannot here give in detail the
long and varied history of the great owners of Bolingbroke.&nbsp;
But, omitting minor particulars:&mdash;&ldquo;A Gilbert de Gaunt
by marrying a Romara heiress, obtained the estate.&nbsp; One of
his successors of the same name, joining the Barons against King
John and Henry III., forfeited it.&nbsp; It was then granted to
Ranulph, Earl of Chester.&nbsp; It afterwards passed to the de
Lacy family, earls in their turn, of Lincoln; and by marriage
with Alicia de Lacy, Thomas Plantagenet, grandson of Henry III.
obtained it, with the title.&nbsp; A later Gaunt, the famous
John, Duke of Lancaster, married the heiress of this branch of
the Plantagenets, and so in turn became Earl of Lincoln and Lord
of Bolingbroke, and their son Henry, born here April 3, 1366,
became Henry IV.&nbsp; As being the birthplace of a sovereign,
the estate, instead of remaining an ordinary manor, was elevated
to the rank of an &lsquo;Honour&rsquo;&rdquo; (Camden&rsquo;s
Britannia, p. 471) and is entitled, in all legal documents
&ldquo;the Honour of Bolingbroke.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since the
accession of Henry IV. it has remained an appanage of the Crown;
and as Duke of Lancaster, King Edward is &ldquo;Lord of the
Honour,&rdquo; at the present day.&nbsp; Gervase Holles states
that Queen Elizabeth made sundry improvements in the interior of
the castle, adding &ldquo;a fayre great chamber with other
lodgings.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Constable of the Castle was (in his
day) &ldquo;Sir William Mounson, Lord Castlemayne, who received a
revenue out of the Dutchy lands of &pound;500 per annum; in part
payment of &pound;1,000 yearly, given by the King to the Countess
of Nottingham his lady.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also says &ldquo;In a
roome in one of the towers they kept their audit for the whole
Dutchy of Lancaster, Bolingbroke having ever been the prime seat
thereof, where the Recordes for the whole country are
kept.&rdquo; <a name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a></p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>And he
then gives a detailed account of the following supernatural
occurrence, as being beyond controversy
authenticated:&mdash;Which is, that the castle is haunted by a
certain spirit in the likeness of a hare; which, &ldquo;att the
meeting of the auditors doth runne betweene their legs, and
sometimes overthrows them, and soe passes away.&nbsp; They have
pursued it downe into the castleyard, and seen it take in att a
grate, into a low cellar; and have followed it thither with a
light, where, notwithstanding they did most narrowly observe it,
and there was no other passage out, but by the doore or windowe,
the roome being all close-framed of stones within, not having the
least chinke or crevice, they could never finde it.&nbsp; Att
other times it hath been seen to run in at the iron grates below
into other of the grotto&rsquo;s (as their be many of them), and
they have watched the place, and sent for hounds, and put in
after it; but aftar a while they came crying out.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Harleian M.S.S. No. 6829, p. 162).&nbsp; The explanation of this
hare-brained story we leave to others more versed in the doings
of the spirit world; merely observing that such an apparition has
not been entirely confined to Bolingbroke Castle.</p>
<p>The town of Bolingbroke confers the title of Viscount on the
family of St.-John of Lydiard Tregoze, Co. Wilts.&nbsp; The
career, the abilities, the accomplishments, the vicissitudes, and
the writings, of the great statesman, author and adventurer,
Henry St.-John, Viscount Bolingbroke, during the reigns of Anne,
William and Mary, and George I. are too well-known, to need
further mention here.</p>
<p>Saunders in his History of Lincolnshire (Vol. ii., p. 101,
1834) says that there was then still in the church the remains of
an altar cloth, beautifully embroidered, and traditionally said
to have been the work of Blanche, Duchess of Lancaster, wife of
John of Gaunt, and mother of Henry IV., who is celebrated in
Chaucer&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;the Dream.&rdquo;&nbsp; Chancellor
Massingberd, however, writing his account of Bolingbroke Castle
in 1858 (&ldquo;Architect Soc. Journ.&rdquo; vol. iv. p. ii.)
says that it had then disappeared, and not been seen for some 20
years, having probably been disgracefully purloined.</p>
<p>The parish register dates from 1538; a rather unusual
occurrence, as the keeping of registers was only enforced
1530&ndash;8 by Act of 27 Henry VIII., and the order was in few
cases observed till a later period.</p>
<h3><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span><span
class="smcap">Edlington</span>.</h3>
<p>This is a pleasant, small village, about 2&frac12; miles from
Horncastle, the chief approach to it being by the so-called
&ldquo;Ramper,&rdquo; the great Roman road, connecting the two
Roman fortresses, Lindum and Banovallum (Lincoln and Horncastle),
and still one of the best roads in the county.&nbsp; The Park of
Edlington, now the property of the Hassard Short family, is a
pleasantly undulating enclosure, adorned with some very fine
trees; although of late some &pound;3,000 worth, chiefly of
outlying timber, has been converted into cash.&nbsp; The ground
is varied by small copses, which afford excellent pheasant and
rabbit shooting; as also do two covers, about two miles from the
Park, called Edlington Scrubs; and there are also some very gamey
plantations, belonging to the estate, situated about two miles
north-west from Woodhall Spa.&nbsp; The estate comprises about
2,700 acres, and is fully five miles long from one end to the
other, being intersected by portions of other parishes.&nbsp;
There was formerly a substantial residence, with stew ponds and
extensive gardens, at the upper or northern end of the park, <a
name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a> with the parish road running behind
it, covered by lofty trees.&nbsp; Here, it may interest the
botanist to know that the plant &ldquo;Butcher&rsquo;s
Broom&rdquo; (Ruscus Aculeatus) grew plentifully, although it now
seems to be extinct, having been improved away.&nbsp; From this
position there is a very fine view, extending many miles to the
south and west, over very varied country.&nbsp; While the late
Mr. Hassard Short himself resided here, he had frequently
coursing parties, hares being then very plentiful, to which,
among others, the present writer, as a boy, and his father, were
always invited.&nbsp; This residence was, however, pulled down
sometime &ldquo;in the fifties,&rdquo; the owner, for the sake of
his health, preferring to reside in the south.&nbsp; It was for a
time, however, occupied by a Mrs. Heald, <a
name="citation34b"></a><a href="#footnote34b"
class="citation">[34b]</a> and her nephew George Heald, Esq., a
fine-looking young fellow, who held a commission in the
Guards.&nbsp; And hereby hangs a tale.&nbsp; <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>In riding in
the Park, in London, he made the acquaintance of the famous
coquette, and adventuress, Lola Montez, created Countess of
Landsfeldt by the King of Hanover, whose mistress she was.&nbsp;
Being a mixture of Spanish and Irish blood, she possessed all the
vivacity of both those races, with a gay dash in her manners, and
considerable beauty, along with an extremely outr&eacute; style
of dress.&nbsp; Thus she fascinated the young man, as she
previously had done her late Royal Master.&nbsp; He married her,
although she was said to have been already married to a Captain
James.&nbsp; The charm soon lost its power, and as a means of
ridding himself of her, his friends prosecuted her for
bigamy.&nbsp; Sergeant Ballantine in his autobiography gives the
whole particulars (vol. II., p. 106), but he does not remember
the result of this action.&nbsp; She was of a temper so violent,
that she commonly carried arms, and was almost reckless of what
she did.&nbsp; Young Heald came at length to live in almost
hourly fear for his life.&nbsp; I well remember his coming down
to a hotel at Horncastle, to receive rents; when he sat at table,
with a loaded pistol at each side of him.&nbsp; I knew him and
his aunt well, and from the latter I received many
kindnesses.&nbsp; The poor persecuted young man soon passed from
mortal ken; but the lady migrated to America, to seek higher game
once more; but a fracas having occurred, in which she shot
someone in a railway carriage, her career also was brought to a
close.</p>
<p>The earliest mention which we have of this part of the Manor
of Edlington, is as being part of the Barony of Gilbert de Gaunt
(some of that name, still residing as farmers in the
parish).&nbsp; He probably, or his ancestors, acquired the
property, from what was a common source, in that day, viz., from
the great Norman Baron, Ivo Taillebois, on whom William the
Conqueror bestowed the rich Saxon heiress, the Lady Lucia, the
representative of the wealthy family of the Thorolds, and near
relative of King Harold (see my records of Old
Bolingbroke).&nbsp; He held this Manor till about the year 35 Ed.
I., or <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1307.&nbsp; It then
passed to the Barkeworthes; Robert de Barkeworthe being the first
of them to reside in the parish, as owner of Poolham.&nbsp; They
were a family of wealth and position in the neighbourhood at that
period.&nbsp; There is a legal document called Feet of Fines
(file 98 [39]), of date <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1329,
in which William de Barkeworthe, and ffloriana his wife, on <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the one part,
and Robert de Haney and Alice his wife, on the other part, lay
claim to considerable property, in Claxby, Normanby and Ussylby,
in which the former establish their claim.&nbsp; In 1351, William
de Barkeworthe presented to a moiety of the chapelry of
Polum.&nbsp; But in 1369, Thomas de Thymbelby presented.&nbsp;
This marks the period when the property passed from the
Barkeworthes to the Thimblebys.&nbsp; A Walter de Barkeworthe
died in 1347, and was buried in the Cloister of Lincoln
Cathedral.&nbsp; At the period of this transition (1369), another
Feet of Fines exists, between Thomas, son of Nicholas de
Thymelby, with several others, on the one part, and Richard,
&ldquo;son of Simon atte See,&rdquo; on the other part, by which
the said Richard surrenders lands in Claxby, Normanby, Tetford,
and other property, to the said Thomas, son of Nicholas de
Thymelby and his friends (&ldquo;Architectural Soc.
Journ.,&rdquo; vol. XXIII., p. 255).&nbsp; There is another Feet
of Fines, in 1374, between Thomas de Themelby, John de Themelby,
Parson, and others, on the one part, and John de Toutheby, and
his wife Alianora, on the other part, which assigns the Manor of
Tetford, and advowson of the church, to the Thymelbys.&nbsp; In
1388, John, son of Thomas de Thymelby, presented to
Tetford.&nbsp; The Thimbleby pedigree is given in the
Herald&rsquo;s Visitation of 1562.</p>
<p>In 1333, at a Chancery Inquisition, held at Haltham, &ldquo;on
Friday next, after the feast of St. Matthew,&rdquo; the Jurors
declare, that Nicholas de Thymelby, and his wife Matilda, hold
land in Haltham, of the right of the said Matilda, under the Lord
the King, as parcel of the Manor of Scrivelsby; also that the
said Nicholas held land in Stikeswold, of the Dean and Chapter of
Lincoln, by the service of paying them ij<sup>s</sup> and
vi<sup>d</sup> yearly; and also that he held lands in Thymelby,
under the Bishop of Carlisle.&nbsp; Further inquisitions show
that Nicholas de Thymelby, and John, his brother, also held lands
in Horncastle and over (<i>i.e.</i> High) Toynton, under the said
Bishop of Carlisle; that Thomas de Thymelby presented to the
Church of Ruckland in 1381; and that John, his son, presented to
the Church of Tetford, April 4th, 1388.&nbsp; In 1427, it was
found that the heirs of John de Thymelby, held by their trustees,
lands &ldquo;in Polum and Edlynton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1439, William Thymelby, Esq., Lord of Polum, presented to
the Benefice of Somersby, having already presented to
Tetford.&nbsp; He seems to have married Joan, <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>daughter of
Sir Walter Tailboys, a descendant of the same family, from which
sprang Ivo Taillebois, the great Norman Baron, previously
mentioned, from whom Gilbert de Gaunt probably acquired his land
in Edlington. <a name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a"
class="citation">[37a]</a>&nbsp; Richard Thimbleby, in 1474,
obtained the Beelsby estates, through marriage with Elizabeth,
daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Beelsby, knight, and widow of Sir
John Pygot, Knt.&nbsp; He died (1522) possessed (in right of his
wife, who was coheir of Godfrey Hilton), of the Manors of
Beelsby, Holton-le-Moor, Horsington, Harpswell, Harleston,
Thorgansby; and a share of the advowson of Horsington; John
Thymelby, his son, succeeded him (Escheator&rsquo;s Inquisitions,
14 H.S., No. 24).&nbsp; To show the religious fanaticism in the
reign of Elizabeth, even among Protestants, note the
following:&mdash;A Thimbleby of Poolham, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1581, was thrown into prison by the
Bishop of Lincoln (T. Cowper), for refusing to attend Protestant
services.&nbsp; His wife was near her confinement, but she begged
to see her husband, she was treated so roughly that the pains of
labour seized her in her husband&rsquo;s dungeon.&nbsp; She was
nevertheless detained in prison without any nurse or assistant,
and a speedy death followed; her husband also dying soon
afterwards in prison from the rough treatment which he underwent
there.&nbsp; (&ldquo;The Church under Queen Elizabeth,&rdquo; by
F. G. Lee, II. p. 60).&nbsp; I have given these details to show
the importance of the family of Thimbleby.</p>
<p>After another generation or two, Matthew Thymbleby&rsquo;s
widow of Poolham, married Sir Robert Saville, Knt., who, through
her, died possessed of the Manors of Poolham, Edlington, and
several more.&nbsp; Confining ourselves here to Poolham, we find
the Saviles, who were members of the Saviles of Howley, co. York
(now represented by Lord Mexborough, of Methley, co. York, etc.,
etc., and the Saviles, of Rufford Abbey, co. Notts.), continuing
to own Poolham until 1600, when Sir John Saville, Knt., sold it
to George Bolles, Esq., citizen of London, whose descendant, Sir
John Bolles, <a name="citation37b"></a><a href="#footnote37b"
class="citation">[37b]</a> Bart., sold it to Sir Edmund Turnor,
of Stoke <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>Rochford.&nbsp; It has recently been sold to Dr. Byron,
residing in London.</p>
<p>As we have, thus far, chiefly confined ourselves to the owners
of the hamlet of Poolham, we will now make some rather
interesting remarks upon the old Poolham Hall, and matters
connected with it.&nbsp; The old mansion was probably built
originally on a larger scale than the present farm house.&nbsp;
It is enclosed by a moat, in the south-west angle of which stand
the remains of a chapel, or oratory, now in the kitchen garden;
they consist of an end wall and part of a side wall, each with a
narrow window.&nbsp; The font, a few years ago, was taken away,
and in order to preserve it from destruction, it was placed, some
twenty years ago, in the garden of Wispington Vicarage, by the
Vicar (the late Rev. C. P. Terrot), a great ecclesiastical
antiquarian.&nbsp; It has further again been removed by the
present writer, and, on the restoration of the Church of St.
Margaret, at Woodhall, in 1893, it was once more restored to its
original purpose, as font in that Church, being further adorned
by four handsome columns of serpentine, the gift of the Rev. J.
A. Penny, the present Vicar of Wispington.&nbsp; Near the chapel,
there was till recently, a tombstone, bearing date 1527.&nbsp;
This stone was a few years ago removed, and now forms the sill of
a cottage doorway in Stixwould.&nbsp; The writer should here add
that, on the moat of this old Hall being cleaned out a few years
ago, there was found in the mud, beneath the chapel ruins, a
curious object, which at once passed into his possession.&nbsp;
It proved to be an ancient chrismatory, of which there has never
been found the like.&nbsp; The material is terra cotta, with
peculiar primitive ornamentation, of a pale stone colour,
containing two divisions, or wells, with spouts at each end, each
having been covered with a roof, although one of them is now
broken off, curiously carved.&nbsp; The use of the chrismatory,
was, in medi&aelig;val times, connected with baptism; as the
child was brought into the church, it was sprinkled with salt,
and at the font it was anointed with oil.&nbsp; The two wells
were meant to hold the salt and oil.&nbsp; As I have said, it is
unique.&nbsp; Its use was first explained to me, by Sir Augustus
Franks, of the British Museum.&nbsp; It has been exhibited among
the <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>ecclesiastical objects of art at the Church Congresses,
at Norwich, London, Newcastle, Northampton, and other
places.&nbsp; It has created very great interest, and has been
noticed in various publications.&nbsp; According to Ecton&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Thesaurus,&rdquo; this chapel was connected with Bardney
Abbey, but it is now a ruin, and unused.&nbsp; The population is
limited to three houses, and the most convenient place of worship
is Woodhall, St. Margaret&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We will now revert more especially to Edlington.&nbsp; We have
mentioned Gilbert de Gaunt as among the first owners, but this
applies, more strictly to the hamlet Poolham.&nbsp; Edlington
proper, is evidently a place of great antiquity, the name is
derived from &ldquo;Eiddeleg,&rdquo; a deity in the Bardic
Mythology (Dr. Oliver&rsquo;s &ldquo;Religious Houses on the
Witham&rdquo;); the whole name meaning the town of
Eiddeleg.&nbsp; In connection with this, we may mention that,
until about three years ago, when it was destroyed by dynamite,
there existed an enormous boulder, standing on a rising ground,
about sixty yards from the present highway, on the farm of Mr.
Robert Searby, which weighed about 10 tons, its height being
about 10ft., width 4ft. 6in., and its thickness about 3ft.&nbsp;
This would be just the Druidic altar, at which the Bardic
mysteries, in the British period, might be celebrated.&nbsp; In
1819, while digging a field in Edlington, some men found several
heaps of ox bones, and with each heap an urn of baked clay.&nbsp;
Unfortunately none of these urns were preserved, so that we are
unable to say whether they were of Roman make, or of earlier
date.&nbsp; They imply heathen sacrifice of some kind, and were
close to a Roman road; still the existence, already mentioned, of
an earlier Bardic worship, would favour for them, an earlier
origin.</p>
<p>From Domesday Book (completed circa 1086), we gather (1st)
that among the possessions of the King (William the Conqueror),
there were 4 carucates, <i>i.e.</i> 480 acres of land, with
proportionate sokemen, villeins, and bordars.&nbsp; The whole
land of the parish being reckoned at 6,960 acres.&nbsp; Of this
extent, the Saxon Ulf, so often mentioned as an owner in this
neighbourhood, had 10 carucates (or 1,200 acres).&nbsp; Egbert,
the vassal of Gilbert de Gaunt had 480 acres, a mill, always a
valuable possession, as all dependants were bound to have their
grain ground there; 90 acres of meadow, and 210 acres of wood
land, in all 780 acres.&nbsp; A Jury of the wapentake of
Horncastle, declared that the powerful noble Robert Despenser,
wrongfully disputed the <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>claim of Gilbert de Gaunt, to half a
carucate, or 60 acres, in Edlington, which in the time of Edward
the Confessor had been formerly held by one Saxon, Tonna.</p>
<p>Edlington was one of the 222 parishes in the county which had
churches before the Norman conquest, but as the number of priests
serving these churches was only 131, it is doubtful whether it
had a resident minister, it being more probably that it was
served by a Monk of Bardney Abbey, to which (according to Liber
Regis) it was attached.&nbsp; Here again we have a trace of
Gilbert de Gaunt being Lord of the Manor of Edlington, as well as
of the subdivision of Poolham.&nbsp; The Monastery of Bardney was
originally one of the few Saxon foundations, and established
before the year 697.&nbsp; It was however reduced to great
poverty by the Danes, under Inguar and Hubba, in 870, 300 monks
being slain.&nbsp; It remained in ruins some 200 years, when it
was restored by Gilbert de Gaunt, who succeeded to some of the
property of Ulf, the Saxon Thane, already named.&nbsp; Gilbert de
Gaunt had 54 Manors conferred upon him; being nephew of the
Conqueror, and among the several which he bestowed on Bardney,
was Edlington.&nbsp; At the dissolution, it would revert to the
King, and (as we are here reduced to conjecture), we may well
suppose that it was one of the many Manors in this district
conferred by Henry VIII., on Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk,
among whose descendants these vast possessions were subsequently
divided.&nbsp; In Dr. Oliver&rsquo;s learned book on the
&ldquo;Religious Houses on the Witham,&rdquo; it is stated that
Bardney had land in Edlington, that the abbot had the advowson of
the benefice, and that before the King&rsquo;s Justices, in the
reign of Ed. I., the abbot proved his right, by act of Henry I.,
confirmed by Henry III. to the exercise of &ldquo;Infangthef,
pit, and gallows at Bardney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Placito de Warranto,&rdquo; p. 409, he claimed, and
proved his right, also to a gallows at Edlington (as well as at
Hagworthingham, and Steeping, and Candlesby); and in connection
with this, it is interesting to note that, as at Bardney, there
is a field called &ldquo;Coney Garth&rdquo; (Konig Garth), or
King enclosure, where the abbot&rsquo;s gallows stood; so at
Edlington there is a field (the grass field, in the angle, as you
pass from the village road to the high road, leading northward),
which is still called &ldquo;Coney Green,&rdquo; which name
moderns of small education, suppose <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>to be derived from the numbers of
conies, <i>i.e.</i> rabbits, which abound there; but in which the
antiquarian sees the old Konig-field, the King&rsquo;s enclosure;
and in that field, doubtless, stood the abbot of Bardney&rsquo;s
gallows; <a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a> just as the Abbots of Kirkstead had a
gallows in Thimbleby.&nbsp; On this Edlington Coney Green, I have
found bricks of an early style, with various mounds and hollows,
indicating buildings of some extent, and probably belonging to
the King.</p>
<p>In the year 1897, the Rev. J. A. Penny, Vicar of Wispington,
discovered and published in &ldquo;Linc. N. and Q.,&rdquo; some
very interesting Bardney charters of the 13th century, which make
many mentions of Edlington.&nbsp; In one case they record the
gift of a bondman, and his progeny to Thomas de Thorley, living
in Gautby, the slave being William, son of Peter Hardigrey, of
Edlington; among the witnesses to the deed of gift being Master
Robert, of Poolham, Simon, the Chamberlain of Edlington, and
others.&nbsp; Date, 22nd May, 1281.</p>
<p>Another is a declaration of Thomas de Thorley, living in
Gautby, that he grants to Master William Hardegrey, Rector of
Mareham, all the lands and tenements which he owns in the village
and fields of Edlington; among the witnesses being Simon, son of
John, the Chamberlain of Edlington; Richard King of the same,
Simon the Francis of Edlington, and others.</p>
<p>Another charter states that, &ldquo;I, William, son of William
of Wispington, have granted, and by this deed confirmed, the
gift, to William Hardigrey, of Edlington, clerk, all my toft,
with its buildings, lying in the parish of Edlington, which is
situate between the public highway, and the croft of Richard, son
of Henry King, for ever.&nbsp; Among the witnesses being Simon,
the Chamberlain of Edlington, John, his son, Alured of Woodhall,
and others.&nbsp; Given at Edlington, the Wednesday after
Michaelmas, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1285.&nbsp; (30th
Sep., 1285), and 13th year of the reign of King Edward
I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We further get disconnected notices of various owners of, or
in, Edlington, but I can not make out a connected series.</p>
<p>For instance, in a Chancery Inquisition, 13. Ed. I. (12th <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>May, 1285),
held by order of the King, among the jurors are Henry of
Horsington, Robert, son of the Parson of Horsington, Hugh
Fraunklyn, of Langton, William de Wodehall, of Edlington, and
others.&nbsp; Thus the William de Woodhall, already named, was a
proprietor in Edlington, as early as 1285.</p>
<p>We find, in a Final Concord, Nov. 22nd, 1208 (three-quarters
of a century earlier than the preceding), between Andrew, of
Edlington, plaintiff, and Alice, daughter of Elvina, who acted
for her, the said Andrew acknowledged the said Alice to be free
(he had probably claimed her as a bond-slave, in his house, or on
his land, at Edlington), for which Alice gave him one mark.&nbsp;
It was only in the reign of Henry VI. that a servant was
permitted, after giving due notice to leave his place, and take
the services of another (23. Hen. VI. c. 13).&nbsp; Before that,
all were the property of their owners, unless given their freedom
for some special reason.&nbsp; Here is another proprietor in a
dispute, on 10th Nov., 1208, between Thorold, of Horsington on
the one part, and John, son of Simon, of Edlington.&nbsp; The
said Thorold surrendered for ever, certain lands in Edlington, to
John and his heirs, another family of proprietors, at the same
date as the previous.</p>
<p>In November, 1218, in a Final Concord, between John, of
Edlington, and Hugh, his tenant, as to the right to certain lands
in Edlington, it was agreed that John was the rightful owner, and
for this, John granted Hugh certain other lands, but in case Hugh
died without issue, they were to revert to John, of
Edlington.&nbsp; He would seem, therefore, to have been rather a
large proprietor.</p>
<p>The will of Richard Evington, of Halsteade Hall, was made, on
22nd January, 1612, by which he leaves his lands in Edlington,
and other places, to his two sons, Maurice and Nicholas
Evington.</p>
<p>On 23rd December, 1616, Edward Turnor, clerk, of Edlington,
made his will, the details of which do not here concern us,
beyond showing that he was Vicar.</p>
<p>The parish register dates from 1562, beginning with Thomas
fforeman, the sonne of William fforeman, christened 2nd February,
1562.&nbsp; This register is very peculiar, as it gives the
baptisms down to 1700, then the marriages from and to the same
dates, then the burials from and to the same dates.&nbsp; This is
very unusual, the common arrangement, in those times, being to
give the baptisms, marriages, <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>and burials under the same dates all
together.&nbsp; The present book is the copy on paper, of the
original on parchment or vellum.&nbsp; Among some of the surnames
are Billinghay, Padison, Melborn, fford, Hollywell, Kaksby,
Stanley, Gunby, Brinkels (Brinkhills), William, son of Thomas
Bounsayne, gent., bap.&nbsp; Jan<sup>y</sup>. 12th, 1605.&nbsp;
Margaret, daughter of John Elton, gent. (and a sister), baptized
October 29th, 1611; and Siorach Edmonds, Vicar, 1617.&nbsp; Mary,
the daughter of Robert Brookley, gent., bapt. Nov. 2nd, 1652;
with others.</p>
<p>This list shews a considerable number of landed proprietors in
the parish; there being no one pre-eminent landowner.</p>
<p>Among the Christian names, which occur in the oldest register,
are Bridgett, Muriall, Rowland, Judith, Dorothie, Anthony,
Hamond, Cicilie, and others.</p>
<p>George Hamerton, gent., and Sarah Hussey, were married June
21st, 1699.&nbsp; [These Hamertons were a wealthy family in
Horncastle, owning a large block of houses at the junction of the
east and south streets.&nbsp; The initials of John Hamerton and
his wife, remain there, over the fire-place, in an oak-pannelled
room.&nbsp; I believe they were connected with the Hamertons, of
Hamerton, co. York.]</p>
<p>John Corbet and Isabell Thylley were married, December 6th,
1660.&nbsp; [The Corbets have been a long-established family in
Lincolnshire, and also taking a leading position in Shropshire,
in Sir Andrew Corbett, Bart].&nbsp; In register III., is a note,
&ldquo;Thomas Barnett, of Thimbelby, found dead in Edlington
parish, and was buried Sep. 6th, 1798&rdquo;; also,
&ldquo;Deborah Bell, aged 95, buried November 7th,
1804.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the 2nd register book, among other entries are
these:&mdash;The Rev. Tristram Sturdivant, Vicar, buried August
3rd, 1755.&nbsp; (The clerk, William Blow, had died 2 years
before).&nbsp; Belmirah, daughter of Thos. Clarke of Horncastle,
and Mary, his wife, buried Feb. 23rd, 1773.</p>
<p>The 3rd register has the following:&mdash;Mr. Wells&rsquo;
youngest child (of Poolham), christened by me, William Wells, at
Poolham, baptized by Mr. L&rsquo;Oste (then Vicar), at Woodhall
Church, named Charles, Aug. 11, 1794.&nbsp; [The Wells&rsquo;
resided at Poolham down to about 1850.&nbsp; They were wealthy
gentlemen farmers, and were most generous to the poor, and
supported the church in every possible way, as I know from my own
experience, and that of my father].</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>Margaret Spencer, a traveller, commonly called
&ldquo;Scotch Peg,&rdquo; she being a Scotch woman, was buried
(at Edlington), Sept. 2, 1789.&nbsp; In the 2nd Register again we
have, among the surnames, Greenland, Walesby, Bouchier, Soulby,
Bates, Longstaffe, Falkner, Bullifant, Gaunt, Elsey, Sturdivant,
Bontoft, Darwin, and others.</p>
<p>We have just mentioned the name of Soulby.&nbsp; I find from
the returns made by Government, that Charles Soulby, and his
brother Edward, both payed the tax for male servants, the former
for 2, the latter for 1, in the year 1780.</p>
<p>Among the Gentry of Lincolnshire, a list of whom was made by
the Royal Heralds in the year 1634, is Thomas Tokyng, of
Edlington, with Ambrose Sheppard, of Hemingby, Robert and John
Sherard, of Gautby, Thomas Morgan, Esq., of Scrivelsby, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.&nbsp; John Rolt, of Edlington, declined the honour, there
being some slight &ldquo;duty&rdquo; chargeable on the
distinction.</p>
<p>Ralph Palframan, clerk, was presented to the Benefice of
Edlington, by his brother Anthony, merchant of the staple, at
Lincoln, by an assignment of the advowson made for this turn by
the late Abbot of Bardney.&nbsp; William Palfreyman was Mayor of
Lincoln in 1536, probably the father.&nbsp; He was instituted
<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1569, on the demise of Leonard
Nurse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Architect, Soc. Journ.,&rdquo; vol. xxiv., p.
15.</p>
<p>The Church of Edlington is dedicated to St. Helen, the mother
of the Emperor Constantine, who was, by birth, a Yorkshire
woman.&nbsp; The edifice was re-built, with the exception of the
lowest part of the tower, in 1859&ndash;60, at a cost of
&pound;1146.&nbsp; It consists of a nave, south aisle, chancel,
and substantial tower of 3 tiers, with 3 bells.&nbsp; The font is
square at the base, octagonal above.&nbsp; The tower arch at the
west end is the original Norman, and the only part remaining of
the original building.&nbsp; The upper part of the tower is in
the Early English style.&nbsp; The windows in the tower are
copies of the former Early English ones, the south arcade is
perpendicular, with windows in the same style, and consisting of
3 bays, with octagonal columns.&nbsp; The Chancel Arch is of good
Early English style.&nbsp; There is a good coloured two-light
window, near the pulpit, in memory of Margaret, the wife of J.
Hassard Short, Esq., who died Feb. 2nd, 1881.&nbsp; The subject
of this window is the three Maries, and the Angel, at <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>the
Sepulchre; combined with his wife, he also by the same window,
commemorated his daughter, Agnes Margarette, who died 17th Dec.,
1867.&nbsp; Another coloured window was placed in the Church in
December, 1900, in memory of the late Squire, the subject being
the Saviour appearing to Mary Magdalene, at the Sepulchre.&nbsp;
Both figures are of life-size, the countenances being full of
expression.&nbsp; It was designed by Messrs. Heaton and Butler,
and placed in position by Mr. C. Hensman, of Horncastle; and
forms a fitting companion to the window in memory of his
wife.&nbsp; It bears the inscription, &ldquo;To the glory of God,
in loving memory of John Hassard Short, Esq., who died Dec. 4,
1893, this window is erected by his daughter Marian.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Shorts have held this estate for four generations.&nbsp; The
flooring is laid with Minton tiles, the church is fitted with
open benches, and pulpit of oak, with reading desk and lectern of
the same.&nbsp; These were the gift of the Lay Impropriators of
the Benefice, the Trustees of Oakham and Uppingham Schools.&nbsp;
The organ is by Stephenson, of Lincoln.&nbsp; The inscription on
the 3 bells (according to North, in his &ldquo;Lincolnshire
Bells&rdquo;), 2 Royal Heads on each, Edwd. I., and Queen
Eleanor; Edwd. III. and Queen Philippa; Henry VI. and Margaret of
Anjou.&nbsp; Further details are given, as that Edlington had, in
1553, &ldquo;three big bells and a Priest&rsquo;s
bell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Inscriptions now, on 1st bell
&ldquo;1824,&rdquo; 2nd bell &ldquo;I.H.S. Sancte Peter,&rdquo;
with diameter of 34 inches; 3rd bell &ldquo;I.H.S., Sancte
Paule&rdquo;; Priest&rsquo;s bell, &ldquo;T.L. TFCW.,
1670,&rdquo; with diameter 11&frac12; inches.</p>
<p>There have been at least 5 Vicars within the last 50
years.&nbsp; The present Vicar, is the Rev. E. H. Bree, formerly
Curate of Belchford, who has a good and commodious residence and
premises, recently enlarged, and good garden, pleasantly situated
close to the Park.</p>
<p>We have said that the former old Residence of the Shorts was
pulled down several years ago; no building has been erected on
the same scale or site since, but a farm house was adopted as a
shooting box, for members of the family; and for the last three
or four years this has been occupied by J. R. Hatfeild, Esq., who
rents the shooting.&nbsp; The Benefice is in the gift of the Lord
Chancellor, as representing the former Patron, the King.</p>
<p>Small as is the parish of Edlington, it has seen some stirring
scenes.&nbsp; On the day before the Battle of Winceby, <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>near
Horncastle, where the Royalists were defeated by Cromwell, viz.,
on the Evening of Tuesday, Oct. 10, 1643, a troop of
Parliamentary Horse, commanded by Capt. Samuel Moody, were
surprised at Edlington, by the King&rsquo;s forces, under the
command of Sir John Henderson and Lord Widdrington, of Blankney,
and there befell a rather sharp skirmish, in which the
Parliamentary troops had to fall back.&nbsp; Such was one
violation of the quietude of the little village.&nbsp; In older
times, lying as it did, between the two Roman forts of Banovallum
(or Cornucastrum) and the ancient Lindum (or Lincoln), it would
often, in the time of the Roman occupation of the country, be
disturbed by the heavy tread of Roman Legions, and the
accompanying music of Roman Clarions.</p>
<p>History also tells us that &ldquo;in the year of our Lord,
1406, Sept. 12, King Henry IV. made a Royal procession from the
town of Horncastle, with a great and honourable company, to the
Abbey of Bardney, where the Abbot and Monastery came out, in
ecclesiastical state, to meet him,&rdquo; [Leland&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Collectanea&rdquo;].&nbsp; As by-roads did not exist, as
they do now, we can hardly doubt, that his line of route would be
by the King&rsquo;s highway, through Edlington.</p>
<p>Surely, even in these days of easy locomotion, it can have
fallen to the lot of few villages, large or small, to have given
to the gaze of their rustic wondering inhabitants, such varied,
and unusual scenes as these.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Mavis Enderby</span>.</h3>
<p>Mavis Enderby is nearly 8 miles from Horncastle, in an
easterly direction, the road passing through High Toynton,
skirting Scrafield, and through Winceby, and Lusby, and being
part of the old Roman road from Doncaster to Wainfleet.&nbsp; It
is about 3 miles west by north of Spilsby, where is the nearest
telegraph office; the nearest money order office being at
Raithby.&nbsp; Letters, via Spilsby, arrive at 7.30 a.m.&nbsp;
The village is prettily situated on a slope of the wolds, the
houses clustering about the church, except solitary farm
residences of a substantial kind; the parish is roughly divided
into Northfield and Southfield.&nbsp; To the north formerly stood
a religious house, a dependency of <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Revesby Abbey.&nbsp; It was last
occupied by C. J. H. Massingberd Mundy, Esq.&nbsp; It fell into
decay some years ago, and nothing now remains of it, beyond the
turf-covered foundations and some fine yew-trees, apparently
survivals of a former avenue leading to it.&nbsp; A varied view
is seen to the north-east, towards Aswardby and Langton,
including the wooded height of Harrington Hill, and other
elevated ground, with the graceful spire of Sausethorpe church
conspicuous in the intervening valley, one of the most successful
creations of the Architect, Stephen Lewin, who, fifty years ago,
did some good work among our Lincolnshire churches, notably in
his restoration of Swineshead, and his re-building of
Brothertoft.&nbsp; The stranger might, by the name of this
parish, be reminded of the lines of Sir Walter Scott. <a
name="citation47a"></a><a href="#footnote47a"
class="citation">[47a]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Merry it is in the good green woods,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Mavis <a name="citation47b"></a><a
href="#footnote47b" class="citation">[47b]</a> and Merle <a
name="citation47c"></a><a href="#footnote47c"
class="citation">[47c]</a> are singing,<br />
When the deer sweep by, and the hounds are in cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the hunter&rsquo;s horn is ringing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But no groves or hedgerows vocal with their songsters, gave
the parish its name.&nbsp; The Lord of the Manor, in the 12th
century was Richard de Malbyse, or Malbishe, a large proprietor,
and exercising considerable influence in this neighbourhood, and
elsewhere.&nbsp; The epithet has been retained to distinguish
this from Bag Enderby, and Wood Enderby; one of which is near and
the other not far away.&nbsp; The name Malbyse or Malbishe,
means, in old Norman French, an evil beast (compare Bis-on); and
the arms of the family, as still preserved at Acaster Malbis,
near York, once belonging to a member of the family, are a
chevron, with three wild stags heads &ldquo;erased,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, raggedly severed from the body.</p>
<p>Domesday Book, however, tells us of owners of land before the
Malbyshes, in pre-Norman times.&nbsp; The Saxon, Thane Elnod,
held land in Mavis Enderby and Raithby and East Keal, in the
reign of Edward the Confessor (p. 31) <a
name="citation47c"></a><a href="#footnote47c"
class="citation">[47c]</a>; while another Saxon, Godwin, whose
name appears in connection with several other parishes, had the
Manor of Mavis Enderby (p. 159) <a name="citation47c"></a><a
href="#footnote47c" class="citation">[47c]</a>&nbsp; The old
hereditary <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>owners of the lands met with no mercy from the
Conqueror, who had to provide for his Norman followers.&nbsp; The
historian records that as William passed along the ranks of his
army before the great Battle of Hastings, he addressed them in a
loud voice thus, &ldquo;Remember to fight well, if we conquer we
shall be rich, if I take this land, you will have it among
you,&rdquo; and the promise then held out, was amply fulfilled;
the vanquished Saxons were robbed of their lands, to reward
William&rsquo;s favorites who had capacious maws.&nbsp; Among
those rewarded extensively with plundered territory, was William
de Karilepho, consecrated Bishop of Durham in 1082, and also made
Chief Justice of England; he received grants of land in Mavis
Enderby, Raithby, Spilsby, Hundleby, Grebby, and many other
places.&nbsp; Ivo Taillebois (equivalent to the modern
Underwood), who was then leader of the Angevin Auxiliaries of the
Conqueror, also received very extensive grants; among them being
lands in Mavis Enderby, Raithby, Hareby, Halton Holgate, Asgarby,
Miningsby and many other demesnes.&nbsp; About the same time also
(1070), another of the Conqueror&rsquo;s favourites
Eudo&mdash;son of Spirewic, subsequently the founder of the
Tattershall family, received very extensive domains, among them
being the Manor of Mavis Enderby, a Berewick (or smaller outlying
portion) in Raithby, another in Hundleby, and in the two Keals,
Hagnaby, and endless more possessions, his head-quarters being at
Tattershall, all of which he held &ldquo;in capite&rdquo; or
directly of the King.&nbsp; But, as we have repeatedly observed
in these notes, these early Norman tenures were precarious, they
were acquired by violence, and when the hand that held them waxed
feeble, a stronger hand, in turn, took possession.&nbsp; Mavis
Enderby, like very many other parishes, became an appurtenance of
the Manor, or Honor, of Bolingbroke, and throughout that great
appanage of the Crown there were many changes in the Lords of
demesnes.</p>
<p>The first of the Malbishes, whose name is recorded, is Osbert
Malbishe, who, with others, is witness to a charter of Revesby
Abbey, of date 1173; this probably is accounted for by the fact
of there being a cell of Revesby Abbey at Mavis Enderby.&nbsp;
Another Malbishe, William, also witnesses another Revesby charter
in 1216.&nbsp; Both these lived before the Richard Malbishe who
is generally referred to as being the Lord of the Manor, whose
name became attached to the parish.</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Among
the &ldquo;Final Concords&rdquo; (p. 162), we find it recorded,
that in a deed, dated 5th June, 1222, Matilda, wife of the above
William Malebisse, claimed certain lands in Enderby (not yet
specially designated &ldquo;Mavis&rdquo;), as her dower, but that
through the agency of Robert de Wion, she quit-claimed all her
rights to that particular portion in favour of one Nicholas and
his heirs, for which the said Nicholas gave her 20s.</p>
<p>In a Chancery Inquisition, 4 Edw. III., 1330, it is shown that
the heirs of Alan Malbish hold certain lands in Sausthorpe and
Langton; and another Inquisition in 1352, mentions &frac14; fee
held in Sauzethorpe and Langton, which the heirs of Alan Malbish
hold.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Archit. S. Journ.,&rdquo; 1894, p. 170.)</p>
<p>After this we hear nothing more of the Malbishe family.&nbsp;
But in a Chancery Inquisition post-mortem, 18 Henry VII., No. 34,
taken at &ldquo;Est Rasen, 26th October, 1502, after the death of
Thomas Fitzwilliam, heir of Sir Thomas Fitzwilliam, Knight,
lately deceased,&rdquo; it is stated that John Vere, Earl of
Oxford, Sir Robert Dymmok, Knight, Robert Rede, Justice of the
Lord the King, Thomas Chaloner, and others, were seized of the
fee of the Manors of Malburssh Enderby, Maydinwell, Malberthorp,
etc., with their appurtenances (which are described as extensive)
to the use of the heirs male of the said Sir Thomas Fitzwilliam
lawfully begotten, and the Jurors further say, that the Manor of
Malburssh Enderby, with appurtenances, etc., are held of the Lord
the King, of the Duchy of Lancaster, as of his Manor of
Bolingbroke, and that certain lands are held of Sir George
Taylboys (doubtless a descendent of Ivo Taillebois, owner in the
days of the Conqueror), but by what services they do not
know.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Architect. Soc. Journ.&rdquo; 1895, p.
14).</p>
<p>The Fitzwilliams still held lands in Mablethorp in the reign
of Henry VIII.&nbsp; One of the family, Sir William Fitzwilliam
was Lord High Admiral, and a staunch supporter of the King in the
rebellion of 1536.&nbsp; Only two years later, in an Inquisition,
20 Henry VII., No. 14 (January 31, 1504&ndash;5).&nbsp; After the
death of George Gedney, it is stated that a certain John Billesby
(of Billesby) <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a> and Nicholas Eland were seized of the
Manor of <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Mabysshenderby, with appurtenances, as well as lands in
Hagworthynham, Bag Enderby, Holbeche, Fleet, and Swaby, and that
they enfeoffed the said George Gedney and Anne his wife of the
aforesaid Manors, to them and their heirs for ever.&nbsp; The
Gedneys continued for many generations an influential family in
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Andrew Gedney, of Bag Enderby, married
Dorothy, daughter of Sir William Skipwith, of South Ormsby, 1536;
and within recent years Arthur P. Gedney, Esq. (a cousin of the
writer of these notes), owned the Manor of Candlesby, and resided
at Candlesby Hall.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Arch. S. Journ.,&rdquo; 1895,
page 27.)</p>
<p>In an Inquisition p.m. in the same year No. 52, after the
death of the said Anne, wife of George Gedney, much of this is
repeated, but it is further specified that the property in
Hagworthingham is held of the Abbot of Bardney; some in Bag
Enderby is held of the Warden of Tateshale, some in Holbeche of
the Lady Dacre de la South, and some in Flete of the Lord Fitz
Water; that the said Anne died on the Saturday after the feast of
the Holy Trinity, and that John Gedney is son and next
heir.&nbsp; In a deed of 14 June, 1535, John Gedney, of Bag
Enderby, refers to his wife&rsquo;s jointure of lands in Mavis
Enderby and other parishes; the said wife being Isabel, heiress
of the Enderbies of Bag Enderby.</p>
<p>In the register of Mavis Enderby, one book of which extends
from 1579 to 1772, an entry shows that George Lilbourne was
Rector from 1522 to 1588, or 66 years.&nbsp; He was a relative of
the Smyths of Elkington, near Louth, who are still represented in
the two parishes of North and South Elkington, as is shown by his
will, dated 5th July, 1587 (Lincolnshire Wills), in which he
requests that he may be buried on the north side of the chancel,
bequeathing &ldquo;to my niece Lacon, my niece Hansard, and my
niece Simpson, an old English crown apiece; to Sir Edward
Hustwaite, all the books he hath of mine, and a great book of St.
Gregory&rsquo;s works, in the hands of Sir Robert Welles, Parson
of Howell; to my servant Agnes Cressie, a silver spoon with
akorne at the end of it; to George Smithe 3<sup>li.</sup>; to
Dorothy and Susan Smyth, 10<sup>s</sup>. apiece; to my nephew
Herbert Lacon, a macer (mazer or drinking bowl), lined with
silver and gilt; to my cousins Thomas Smithe and Anthony Smithe,
and my nephew Tristram Smithe a little silver salt
(cellar).&nbsp; I make my nephew Herbert <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Lacon, and
Mr. Thomas Taylor, supervisors.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Prob., 8 May,
1588).</p>
<p>It would appear that he was more generous in lending his books
than his friends were careful in returning them, the latter, a
failing not unknown in our own day, and even St. Paul could write
to Timothy (2 T. iv. 13), &ldquo;Bring with thee the books, but
especially the parchments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among Lincolnshire Wills is one of Roger Metcalf, clerk of
Mavis Enderby, dated 18 July, 1606, in which he desires to be
buried in the chancel, John Downes of Lusby, clerk, being left
executor, and George Littlebury of Somersby, Gent., and John
Salmon of Haltham-on-Bain, clerk, supervisors.&nbsp; We thus see
that in Saxon times, lands in Mavis Enderby and Raithby were held
by the same owner, and that in early Norman times, lands in the
two parishes were held more than once by the same Lord.&nbsp; In
a Feet of Fines, Lincoln, file 68 (32), 30 Ed. I., there was a
dispute between John Beck (of the ancient family of Bec, of
Eresby, Lusby, etc.) and Robert de Wylgheby (ancestor of the
Lords Willoughby) about the Manors and advowsons of Enderby
Malbys, and Ratheby, as well as other properties, in which the
said Robert granted to the said John the said lands and
advowsons.&nbsp; &ldquo;Architect. S. Journal,&rdquo; 1897, p.
56.&nbsp; And in the present day the two benefices are held
together by the Rev. George Ward, who is himself patron of Mavis
Enderby, Raithby being in the gift of the crown.</p>
<p>Early in the seventeenth century, the benefice was held by the
Rev. James Forrester, who was chaplain to Anne, Queen of James
I., and wrote a curious book, entitled &ldquo;The Marrowe Juice
of 260 Scriptures, or Monas-Tessera-Graphica&rdquo;; printed at
the signe of the crowne, in Paul&rsquo;s churchyard, 1611.</p>
<p>The head of one of our old and distinguished Lincolnshire
families, Sir Edward Ascough, presented to the benefice in 1679
and 1685.&nbsp; In 1734, Decimus Reynolds presented, and in 1782
Henry Best, Esq., presented.&nbsp; &ldquo;Liber Regis.,&rdquo;
s.v., Malvis, alias Maurice, Enderby.</p>
<p>The present owners of the parish are Mrs. Rashdall of London,
Mrs. Coltman of Hagnaby, Mr. Holmes of Eastville, and the
Rector.</p>
<p>It need hardly be said that the poem, by Miss Ingelow, of
Boston, called &ldquo;The Brides of Mavis Enderby,&rdquo; has no
connection with this parish, being entirely imaginary, <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>except that
it is founded on the fact of a high tide on the Lincolnshire
coast.&nbsp; It was published in 1849, and Tennyson, the
Laureate, much admired it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Life of Lord
Tennyson,&rdquo; Vol. I., p. 287.&nbsp; The name was chosen as
being euphonious.</p>
<p>The Church, dedicated to St. Michael, consists of tower, nave
with south aisle, and chancel.&nbsp; The tower is of three
stories.&nbsp; In the western wall, above the west door, is a
three-light trefoiled perpendicular window, above this a clock,
above that a smaller three-light window, similar windows being in
all four faces.&nbsp; The sill of the west door is an ancient
stone, with the &ldquo;Runic involuted knot&rdquo; pattern,
which, however, is almost obliterated by the tread of worshippers
entering by the door.&nbsp; It is similar to the Runic stone at
Miningsby.&nbsp; The church has been restored or rebuilt at
various periods.&nbsp; The tower, originally a lofty one, but a
large part of which, through decay of the sandstone, had fallen
down, was partly rebuilt in 1684, and a lower bell-chamber
provided.&nbsp; In 1894 it was again restored, and carried up to
its original height.&nbsp; The chancel also was rebuilt to its
original length in 1871, and the nave, aisle, and porch were
handsomely restored in 1878.&nbsp; There are three bells.&nbsp;
On the south interior wall of the tower is an inscription on a
tablet, recording that the tower was restored and clock set up in
1894, in memory of four generations of the Ward family,
&ldquo;who were married in 1704, 1728, 1783, 1836, G. Ward,
F.S.A. (Rector), W. Sharpe (Churchwarden), their 23rd year of
office together, C. Hodgson Fowler (Architect), Edwd. Bowman and
Sons (Contractors).&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the north wall of the nave is a door, two three-light
trefoiled windows, with two quatrefoils above.&nbsp; The south
aisle consists of three bays, one of the original sandstone
pillars still remains in the north corner of the west end, next
to the tower wall, where there is also a two-light window behind
the font.&nbsp; In the south wall, east of the porch, are two
windows of three lights, one of the decorated style, the other
perpendicular, both square-headed.&nbsp; The eastern one has
coloured glass, by Clayton and Bell, the subjects being&mdash;in
the centre the annunciation, to the east the angel appearing to
Zacharias, to the west the visitation, adapted from the famous
picture by Mariotto Albertinelli, in the Academy Gallery, at
Florence.&nbsp; The seats are of modern oak, with carved
poppy-heads, except one or two ancient ones preserved from an
older structure near the tower, and <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the roof throughout is of red
deal.&nbsp; There is a modern oak rood screen, with rood-loft,
having standing figures of angels, one on each side, as well as
one over the pulpit.&nbsp; These were originally in Louth
church.&nbsp; The pulpit and reading desk are of modern
oak.&nbsp; The font is octagonal, decorated with plain Ogee arch
on each face.&nbsp; The south porch is modern, but having a
curious old stoup, the pedestal being a cluster of early English
columns, the bowl of a rather later date, in keeping with the
carving round the doorway; these have probably been imported from
elsewhere.&nbsp; The chancel, entirely modern, has a three-light
east window, both the tracery and coloured glass being adapted
from a window in Louth church (where the Rector was formerly
Curate), the glass being by Clayton and Bell, the tracery by the
late Mr. James Fowler of Louth.&nbsp; The subjects
are&mdash;below, the agony, crucifixion and entombment, and
above, the annunciation, with six-winged cherubim on either
side.&nbsp; In the south wall are two windows of two lights, with
quatrefoil above.&nbsp; On the north is an organ chamber, with
low wide arch, and a modern piscina and aumbrey in the
wall.&nbsp; The altar cloths are very handsome, the upper cover
being crimson plush, decorated with shields, and the cross and
scales; the frontals are gifts of various persons, one of
Algerian red silk and gold work in three compartments; a second
of white silk, worked by Mrs. Clarke, late of Stainsby House,
with the Agnus Dei in the centre; the third is of green silk,
with very rich embroidery; the fourth, of plain purple velvet,
with four bands of darker purple, for the Lent season.</p>
<p>The churchyard cross has been recently restored after the
fashion of the Somersby cross, a portion of the shaft being
old.&nbsp; There is also a modern sun dial, erected by the
present Rector.&nbsp; Fragments of the old tower, and of the
Norman sandstone pillars, form ornaments in the Rectory
garden.</p>
<p>The present Rectory was built in 1871, the architect being the
late Mr. James Fowler, of Louth, it has been added to since that
date, and now forms a commodious residence in pretty grounds, and
a picturesque situation.</p>
<p>It may be added, as an incident of special interest, that the
father of the late Sir John Franklin, the arctic explorer, on
retiring from business in Spilsby, bought a portion of ground in
this parish, in south field, and built a house, now occupied by
Mr. W. R. Cartwright, in <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>which he resided for some years, and
in which Sir John Franklin spent his youth.</p>
<p>Some years ago, the Rector found in his garden a silver groat
of Philip and Mary, two Nuremberg tokens, and a half-penny of
William III.</p>
<p>The church and parish, in their past and present history, are
among the most interesting in the neighbourhood.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Fulletby</span>.</h3>
<p>Fulletby lies about 3&frac12; miles from Horncastle, in a
north-east by north direction, on the road to Belchford.&nbsp;
Letters, <i>via</i> Horncastle, arrive at 10 a.m.&nbsp; The
nearest Money Order Office is at Belchford, the nearest Telegraph
Office at Tetford, or Horncastle.&nbsp; We do not know very much
of the ancient history of this parish.&nbsp; In Domesday Book it
is stated (&ldquo;Lands of the Bishop of Durham&rdquo;) that the
Saxons, Siward and Edric, had there two carucates (or about 240
acres) and six oxgangs of land, rateable to gelt.&nbsp; William,
a vassal of the Bishop <a name="citation54"></a><a
href="#footnote54" class="citation">[54]</a> had also there two
carucates (or 240 acres) and five villeins and 19 socmen, who had
two carucates and two oxgangs.&nbsp; In Hearne&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Liber Niger&rdquo; (vol. ii) Ranulph, Bishop of Durham, is
said to have &ldquo;in Fuletebi and Oxcum 4 carucates and 6
oxgangs which Pinson holds&rdquo; (Circa <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1114).&nbsp; Pinson was a Norman
soldier, Dapifer, or Steward of the Durham Bishops, and held many
lands in this neighbourhood under them for the service of acting
as their bailiff; the Bishop holding, &ldquo;in chief,&rdquo;
direct from the sovereign.&nbsp; Pinson thus became (deputy) Lord
of Eresby, and other Episcopal Lordships, and by the marriage of
Walter de Beck, with Agnes, a daughter of Hugh Pinson, several of
these lands passed to the family of Bec, or Bek; one of the
family, Anthony de Bec, himself became Bishop of Durham.&nbsp; In
1214 the <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>Bishop of Durham&rsquo;s land in Fulletby and Oxcomb was
held under him by Henry Bec, and in the reign of Ed. I. John Beck
and John de Harington held a Fee (doubtless the same property in
Fulletby and Oxcombe).&nbsp; At another date, temp King Henry
II., a certain &ldquo;Count Richard,&rdquo; probably the Earl of
Chester, had &ldquo;in Fulledebi 2 carucates.&rdquo;&nbsp; By the
marriage of Sir William Willoughby with a daughter of Baron Bec,
of Eresby, several of these Lordships passed to the Willoughby
d&rsquo; Eresby family; and among them (&ldquo;Testa de
Nevill,&rdquo; page 318) were lands in &ldquo;ffotby&rdquo;; and
in Feet of Fines, Lincoln, (file 69, 31, Ed. I. <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1303) it is stated that Robert de
Wylgheby held &ldquo;rent of 6 quarters of salt in ffoletby,
Beltefford, Golkesby, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; While Gervase Holles
says (&ldquo;Collectanea,&rdquo; Brit. Mus., vol. iii., p. 770)
that in the reign of Elizabeth, &ldquo;Carolus, Dominus
Willoughby de Parham,&rdquo; was Lord of the Manor of Fulletby
(&ldquo;Old Lincolnshire,&rdquo; vol. i., pp.
213&ndash;214).&nbsp; The lands have passed from these old owners
many years ago, and are now the property of the Elmhirst, Booth,
Riggall, and other families.</p>
<p>In the rebellion, called &ldquo;the Lincolnshire
Rising,&rdquo; in 1536, Robert Leech, of Fulletby, joined with
the insurgents, and, although his brother, Nicholas Leech, parson
of Belchford, escaped trial, Robert was put to death with Thomas
Kendall, vicar of Louth, the Abbots (Matthew Mackerell) of
Barlings, and (Richard Harrison) of Kirkstead, and many
others.&nbsp; Their names were included in a &ldquo;List of
Lincolnshire Martyrs,&rdquo; sent to the Apostolic See, who were
&ldquo;first made Venerable, then Blessed, and lastly
Canonised,&rdquo; by his holiness, for their steadfastness in the
Papal cause.&nbsp; Other persons, known by name, connected with
the parish as patrons of the benefice, have been the heirs of
Nicholas Shepley in 1701; George Lascells, Esq., in 1741; Thomas
Rockliffe, Esq., in 1782; Francis Rockliffe, clerk, in 1784; Mrs.
A. R. Rockliffe, 1826; Rev. J. Jackson in 1863.&nbsp; F.
Charsley, Esq., is the present patron; and Rev. R. Barker is
rector, who has a substantial residence in the parish.&nbsp; The
benefice was formerly charged with a pension of 6s. 8d. to
Bullington Priory.</p>
<p>The Church, St. Andrews, is a modern edifice, almost entirely
rebuilt in 1857 by Messrs Maughan and Fowler, of Louth; a
previous larger church having been erected in 1705, on the site
of a Saxon church, mentioned by <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>Archdeacon Churton, in his
&ldquo;English Church,&rdquo; as one of the two hundred and
twenty-two churches in Lincolnshire existing before the Norman
conquest.&nbsp; No traces of the original Saxon church
remain.&nbsp; The fabric, 400 years ago, is said to have been
considerably longer, to have had a tower, and north and south
aisles.&nbsp; In the later fabric, the aisles had disappeared, as
shewn in an old print, and the tower which partly fell, in 1799,
was then cut down to the level of the nave roof, with a small
wooden bell-turret above it.</p>
<p>The Land Revenue Records (bundle 1392) state that there were
&ldquo;iij bells and a lytel bell.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1566 the
Churchwardens reported a &ldquo;sacringe bell&rdquo; as still
remaining (Peacock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Church Furniture&rdquo; p.
81.)&nbsp; There are now only two bells; and a tradition still
lingers, that the largest of the former bells now hangs in the
belfry of Tetford church.&nbsp; In 1834, the Church, like several
others in the neighbourhood, was thatched; at that date the roof
was repaired, and covered with tiles.</p>
<p>The east window is a good triplet, in early English
style.&nbsp; The present pulpit was put up by the late Rector,
the Rev. G. E. Frewer; and, along with the Reredos, was carved by
Mr. Winn, living in the parish.&nbsp; The reading desk was carved
by a former Rector, Rev. J. Jackson, but has of late years, been
altered.&nbsp; There is a handsome brass lectern given by the
present Rector, Rev. R. Barker.&nbsp; In the floor of the chancel
is a slab, with this inscription, &ldquo;Depositum Ricardi Dugard
qui obiit anno &aelig;tatis 68, salutis 1653, Januarii
28.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is supposed to have been a nephew of William
Dugard, who printed the original edition of &ldquo;Ikon
Basilike,&rdquo; in his own house.&nbsp; The two present bells
are inscribed &ldquo;Warner and Sons, 1857.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the
registers previous to 1750 have been lost.&nbsp; Of the communion
plate, the chalice and paten are dated 1688; the flagon is
modern.</p>
<p>In 1566 there was in the church &ldquo;one alb, one cope, a
crosse, super altaire, ij images, a mass, a piece of wood,
whereon stood xxiv candels.&rdquo;&nbsp; George Monson, the royal
commissioner, ordered that &ldquo;they must awaie with (these)
this side the first of Maie, and certifie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1846 six Roman urns, containing calcined bones, were dug up
in this parish in an abandoned brickyard; and, about 5 years
afterwards, another similar urn was found near the same
place.&nbsp; There are still found there a <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>considerable
quantity of fossils, ammonites, gryph&aelig;a, &amp;c.; and the
writer of these notes possesses a vertebra of a large saurian,
one of several which have quite recently been found at the same
place.</p>
<p>Fulletby School was rebuilt in 1849.&nbsp; The 1st stone being
laid in the last week in August, to contain 60 children, by Dr.
Spranger, Rector of Low Toynton, who gave handsomely, besides
building at his own expense and endowing a School at New
York.&nbsp; The Rev. W. M. Pierce, Rector, contributed, also Mrs.
Elmhirst, of Yorkshire; the Lady of the Manor, the Queen Dowager
giving &pound;10.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Lincolnshire Chronicle,&rdquo;
August 28th, 1849).</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Goulceby</span>.</h3>
<p>Goulceby lies in a northerly direction, about 7 miles from
Horncastle, some two miles further on than Scamblesby, and barely
a mile west of Asterby, to which parish it is now
ecclesiastically annexed; the joint value of the two benefices,
the former a vicarage and the latter a rectory, being about
&pound;380 a year, now held by the Rev. J. Graham, J.P., who
resides at Asterby.&nbsp; Goulceby was probably, in Saxon times,
the more important of the two places, since it was one of the 222
parishes in the county (according to Sir Henry Ellis) which
possessed a church before the Norman Conquest, and one of the 131
which had a resident priest.</p>
<p>Letters arrive <i>via</i> Lincoln at 10 am., and are
despatched at 3.55 p.m.&nbsp; The nearest money order office is
at Scamblesby, the nearest telegraph office at Baumber; but, by
arrangement, telegrams can be sent from the Donington-on-Bain
station, on the Lincoln and Louth railway, which is distant about
2 miles.</p>
<p>The village lies in a valley which is watered by a branch of
the river Bain.&nbsp; The patronage of the benefice has been in
various hands.&nbsp; In pre-reformation times it belonged to the
Preceptory of the Knights Templars at Willoughton; in 1605 it was
held by Christopher Pickering (&ldquo;Liber Regis&rdquo;), later
by a Mr. Hatley (Ecton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thesaurus&rdquo;); then by
the Listers of Burwell Park, who presented as late as 1837; from
whom the patronage, with the manor, was acquired by the Bagnell
family; whose representative now <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>presents to the united benefice,
alternately with the Traffords, as Lords of the Manor of
Asterby.&nbsp; At what period the original church perished does
not appear to be recorded; but, according to Weir (&ldquo;History
of Lincolnshire,&rdquo; ed. 1828) there was in 1821 only a small
modern church, dedicated to all Saints.&nbsp; This fell into
decay, and in 1855 was succeeded by a small brick and stone
structure; which, in turn, has more recently been taken down; and
the church at Asterby now serves for the two parishes.</p>
<p>Historic references to this parish are &ldquo;few and far
between,&rdquo; yet by bringing them together, with a moderate
degree of assumption from given premises, we can make out a
fairly connected catena of its ownership.&nbsp; The name itself
can hardly be said to give a certain sound.&nbsp; It has been
variously spelt, as Golsby, Goldesby, Gouthesby, Golksby,
Colceby, and, in Domesday Book, Colchesbi.&nbsp; We can only
conjecture that it may have been the &ldquo;Buy,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, Byre, or farmstead of a Saxon Thane, named Col, Kol,
or Golk, the two former being common as contractions of Colswen,
or Colegrim, and not uncommon in the neighbourhood. <a
name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58"
class="citation">[58]</a></p>
<p>According to Domesday Book, this, like many other parishes in
the neighbourhood, was among the possessions of the Norman noble,
Ivo Taillebois, acquired through his marriage with the Lady
Lucia, the wealthy Saxon heiress of the Thorolds, and connected
with the Royal line of King Harold.&nbsp; He (or she), had here 3
carucates of land (or 360 acres), rateable to gelt; with 16
socmen and 2 villeins, occupying 6 carucates (or 720 acres); a
mill worth 4s. yearly; a church and priest, and 120 acres of
meadow.&nbsp; As I mention in notices of other parishes
(Bolingbroke, Scamblesby &amp;c.), the tenure of these demesnes
was not of long duration, and in a few years they were dispersed
among the descendants of the Saxon heiress.&nbsp; Goulceby would
seem to have become an appurtenance, with Belchford, Donington
and several others, of the superior manor of Burwell.&nbsp; It
would thus be granted, originally, by Henry I. to the Norman
family of De la Haye, one of whom, in the 13th century, founded
the Benedictine Alien Priory of Burwell, as a dependency <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>of the Abbey
of S. Mary Silv&aelig; Majoris, near Bourdeaux, and endowed it
with some of his own demesnes.&nbsp; This family held these
possessions for 150 years.&nbsp; The last of them, John De la
Haye, in the reign of Edward I., having enfeoffed Philip de Kyme
of the same, continued for the remainder of his life to hold the
lands, under the said Philip, by the peculiar (nominal)
&ldquo;service of <i>one rose</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Chancery
Inquis., post mortem, 21, Edward I., No. 33).&nbsp; For some
years the Kymes held the property, being called to Parliament as
Barons, and doing other service for their sovereigns; until in 12
Edward III. (Dugdale&rsquo;s &ldquo;Baronage,&rdquo; i., 621)
William of that name died without issue; and his widow married as
her second husband, Nicholas de Cantelupe (whose ancestors had
been Earls of Abergavenny), who thus succeeded to these
demesnes.&nbsp; He dying also without issue, on the subsequent
death of his widow, the property reverted to Gilbert de
Umfraville, Earl of Angus, who had been enfeoffed of it by his
uncle, the above William.&nbsp; Gilbert, again, died without
issue, and his widow married Henry Percy, created at the
coronation of Richard II., the 1st Earl of Northumberland, who
thus in turn acquired the property.&nbsp; He, however, rebelled
against Henry IV. (Camden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; p.
547); and on his attainder that sovereign granted the manors to
his son John, afterward.&nbsp; Duke of Bedford (Patent Rolls, 6,
H. iv., p. 2., m. 16s)&nbsp; He dying without issue, the property
reverted to the crown, and Henry VI. granted it to Ralph, Lord
Treasurer Cromwell.&nbsp; (Patent Roll 18, H. vi., pt. 2, m.
19).</p>
<p>Before this period, however, the Cromwells were connected with
Goulceby, since it is shewn, by an Inquisition in the reign of
Henry V. (post mortem, No. 72, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1419), that Matilda, the wife of Sir Ralph Cromwell, Knight, held
lands in Roughton, Wodehall, Langton, Golseby, Belcheford,
Donington, etc., <a name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59"
class="citation">[59]</a> and that Sir Ralph Cromwell her son was
the next heir.&nbsp; When the Lord Treasurer founded at
Tattershall, the College of the Holy Trinity, on the 17th Henry
VI. (1439), he endowed <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>it with portions of many of these
manors, as had also been done in the case of Burwell Priory,
centuries before; Goulceby doubtless being one of them.&nbsp; On
the dissolution of Religious Houses by Henry VIII. a great number
of the lands connected with them in this neighbourhood were
bestowed by that sovereign on Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk,
among these being Goulceby, Belchford, ffulletsbye, etc. <a
name="citation60a"></a><a href="#footnote60a"
class="citation">[60a]</a>&nbsp; He died 24 August, 1545, leaving
two sons, Henry and Charles, by his wife Catherine, daughter and
heiress of William Lord Willoughby de Eresby.&nbsp; They, while
at St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, died of the epidemic,
called &ldquo;the sweating sickness,&rdquo; 16 July, 1551
(Cooper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Athen&aelig; Cantabridgenses,&rdquo; i.,
105); whereupon the descendants of the daughters of their great
grandfather, Sir William Brandon, were declared the rightful
heirs.&nbsp; One of these, Eleanor, had married John Glemham, of
Glemham Parva, Suffolk, and their great grandson succeeded Thomas
Glemham, Burwell, and a considerable portion of these demesnes.
<a name="citation60b"></a><a href="#footnote60b"
class="citation">[60b]</a>&nbsp; He died about the 14 year of
Queen Elizabeth, and was succeeded by his son Henry, afterwards
Sir Henry Glemham, Knight, who married Lady Anne Sackville,
daughter of the Earl of Dorset. <a name="citation60c"></a><a
href="#footnote60c" class="citation">[60c]</a>&nbsp; He settled
upon his wife, Burwell, with appurtenances; and documents
connected with the Lister family (subsequently owners of Burwell,
etc.), now in the possession of Porter Wilson, Esq., shew that,
in 1602, the farm rents included those from &ldquo;Goulsby,
Belchforde, Donington super bayne,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; We now
proceed a step further to another change of ownership:&mdash;In
1641, Sir Thomas Glemham, of Burwell, was a strong supporter of
Charles I., being Colonel of the King&rsquo;s 4th Regiment, and
successively, Governor of York, Carlisle, and Oxford. <a
name="citation60d"></a><a href="#footnote60d"
class="citation">[60d]</a>&nbsp; He, probably in order to raise
funds for his royal master, sold for &pound;15,000, the Burwell
estate and its many appurtenances, to Sir Matthew Lister, Knight,
of St. Martin in the Fields, co. Middlesex, and Martin Lister, of
Thorpe Arnold, co. Leicester, his brother.&nbsp; It is somewhat
curious that in the <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>list of manors, which then changed hands, although
Belchford, Oxcombe, ffaireforth (<i>i.e.</i> Farforth), and
Walmesgate, all in the near neighbourhood of Goulceby, are named,
no mention is made of Goulceby itself, yet down to as recently as
1863 the patronage of the benefice was vested in them
(Morris&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gazetteer,&rdquo; 1863).&nbsp; It appears,
however, from a deed of settlement, dated 10 Jan. 1656&ndash;7
(or about 15 years after the sale), that Sir Martin Lister, of
Thorpe Arnold, was possessed of Belchford, Colceby, &amp;c.; and
after his death, his children were to divide his property, and
the trustees were &ldquo;empowered to sell, if necessary,
Belchford, Colceby,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; It is possible that by
this &ldquo;Colceby,&rdquo; Calceby may be intended, which was
annexed to Driby and Ormsby; but it certainly looks as if
Goulceby formed a part of the share of the property originally
bought by Sir Matthew Lister&rsquo;s brother Martin.&nbsp; The
Listers continued to be owners of Burwell, doubtless at different
periods parting with various of the subsidiary
&ldquo;appurtenances&rdquo; down to a few years ago;
intermarrying with the Dymokes, Alingtons, Gregorys of Harlaxton,
Lord Deloraine, members of the families of Sir Robt. Barkham,
Knollys, Sir Edward Boughton, and forming other good
connections.&nbsp; Only in 1883, was the property finally parted
with by the late Matthew Henry Lister, eldest son of Matthew
Bancroft Lister, High Sheriff in 1800, to the present owner,
William Hornsby, Esq., High Sheriff in 1898.&nbsp; We may add
that Matthew Bancroft Lister claimed descent from Philip of Kyme;
whose family, we have seen, were owners of Goulceby, in the reign
of Edward I., and in 1840 he petitioned the Queen for a revival
in his person of the Barony of Kyme; but that dignity still
remains in abeyance.&nbsp; Of the Matthew Lister who married
Eleanor, daughter of the Hon. Sir Charles Dymoke, Knight,
champion of James II. (Circa 1683), it is recorded that he had a
son &ldquo;Martin, baptized 1 October, buried in woollen 30 Nov.,
1693.&rdquo; <a name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61"
class="citation">[61]</a>&nbsp; For these particulars as to the
ownership of Goulceby in the past, I am largely indebted to a
paper in the &ldquo;Architectural Society&rsquo;s Journal&rdquo;
for 1897, by Mr. R. W. Goulding, entitled &ldquo;Notes on the
Lords of the Manor of Burwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>The
present owners of Goulceby are Colonel Bagnell, Lord of the
Manor, Earl Manvers, Thomas Falkner Alison, and various small
proprietors.</p>
<p>The following particulars of the Listers are worthy of
mention.&mdash;Sir Matthew Lister, M.D., was fellow of Oriel
College, Oxford; Physician to Queen Anne, Consort of James I.;
and Physician in Ordinary to Charles I., by whom he was knighted
in 1636 (Woods&rsquo; &ldquo;Fasti Oxon.,&rdquo; 3rd ed., 1815,
i., 307&ndash;8), he died at the age of 92.&nbsp; The entry of
his burial is as follows, &ldquo;Matthew Lyster, Kt. &amp; cheefe
lord of Burwell, &amp;c., was buried December the 19th,
1657.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among the bequests in his will, dated 18th
August, 1656, are the following:&mdash;To his wife all his
household stuff . . ., all &ldquo;the jewells she usually
weareth, and hath in her custodie&rdquo;; also his &ldquo;coach
and coach-horses, if he should have any at his
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Item, I give to be divided between her
and my neece, Sir Martin Lister&rsquo;s wife, all that poure
remnant of Plate which is left me since these
troubles.&rdquo;&nbsp; To his &ldquo;son in law George Banfield,
and to his sister, the Ladie Cobham, &pound;10 for a
remembrance.&rdquo;&nbsp; To his &ldquo;servant John Mitchele,
&pound;50 . . ., and if he bee with me at my death all my wearing
apparel, except one <i>fringed sattin gown lyned with furre
called ffitches</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, Marten skins), which I desire
my wife may have.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may assume that this was some
official, or court, robe worn by Sir Matthew on occasions of
ceremony.&nbsp; He was President of the London College of
Physicians, and even in our own day, members of a College wear
the &ldquo;gowns&rdquo; of their degree or office.</p>
<p>Another member of the family, Martin Lister, M.D., F.R.S., was
one of Queen Anne&rsquo;s Physicians, an eminent zoologist, and
author of books on various branches of Natural History.&nbsp; His
most important work was his &ldquo;Historia sive, synopsis
Methodica Conchyliorum.&rdquo;&nbsp; Various plants and animals
have been named after him.</p>
<p>Two or three other documents connected with Goulceby, may be
here briefly referred to:&mdash;</p>
<p>By a Final Concord, dated 20 June, 1202, an agreement was made
between Holda, daughter of Geoffrey, on the one hand, and certain
Monks of Minting Priory, who were tenants of an oxgang of land in
Goutheby, by which she surrendered all claim to the land, in
favour of the Monks and their successors for ever.&nbsp; In
return for which the Monks gave her one mark.</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>On July
28, 1231, an agreement was made between the Master of the Knights
Templars in England, and William Moysaunt and Amice his wife, by
which the said William and Amice acknowledged a certain meadow in
Golkesby to be the right of the said Master &ldquo;to have and to
hold, to him and his successors, in free, pure, and perpetual
alms&rdquo;; and for this the said Master gave them 2s.</p>
<p>By will, dated 30 May, 1617, Adam Henneage of Donynton Super
Bane, Gent, left to Frances his wife &ldquo;all my messuage in
Goulcebie, wherein John Clarke now dwelleth&rdquo;; and to his
&ldquo;sonne James his copyhold land in Goulcebie, in tenure of
Peter Pindar and John Tomson.&rdquo;&nbsp; Proved at Horncastle,
28 June, 1617.&nbsp; By will, dated 23 July, 1623, Thomas Kent,
of Scamblesby, Clerk, left &ldquo;to the poor people of the
parish of Goulceby, 20s.,&rdquo; with similar bequests to the
poor of Donington and Scamblesby.&nbsp; Proved at Lincoln, 15
Nov., 1623.</p>
<p>The will of Timothy Kent, of Donington, Clerk, dated 13 Feb.,
1623&ndash;4, mentions lands in Goulceby and Asterby, and leaves
bequests to various relations and servants, and to the Cathedral
Church, Lincoln, 2s., and to the poor of Donington, 20s.&nbsp;
Proved at Lincoln, 28 May, 1624.&nbsp; Elias Kent, of Scamblesby,
Gent., by will, dated 13 Feb., 1625, leaves various bequests to
relatives and friends, and &ldquo;to the poorest people of
Goulceby 10<sup>s</sup>., to those of Donington 10<sup>s</sup>.,
to those Scamblesby 40<sup>s</sup>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Proved at
Lincoln, 20 Dec., 1628.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Lincs. N. &amp; Q.,&rdquo;
Vol. III., pp. 205&ndash;207).</p>
<p>The poor of Goulceby have an annual rent charge of &pound;2
10s., left by Anthony Acham, which is distributed in bread.&nbsp;
He also in 1638 founded, and endowed with &pound;10 yearly, a
school here; which was re-built in 1865, with accommodation for
130 children; the original endowment is now supplemented from
other sources, and the school serves for the parishes of
Goulceby, Asterby, and Stenigot.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Greetham</span>.</h3>
<p>Greetham is distant about 3&frac12; miles from Horncastle, in
an easterly direction, lying just beyond the parish of High
Toynton, south of Fulletby, west of Ashby Puerorum and north of
Winceby.&nbsp; The village is chiefly situated on a cross-road
running north and south (and probably Roman) <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>which unites
the road from Horncastle to Tetford with that from Horncastle to
Hagworthingham and Spilsby.&nbsp; The nearest money order and
telegraph office is at Horncastle, whence the letters arrive at
9.20. a.m.&nbsp; The population of this village is now just over
130; but, as Isaac Taylor says (&ldquo;Words and Places,&rdquo;
p. 1), &ldquo;local names are records of the past,&rdquo; and
Greetham, as its name implies, was at one time a place of
considerably more importance than at present.&nbsp; The Saxons
named it Greetham, or the great village; which, as Mr.
Streatfeild suggests (&ldquo;Lincolnshire and the Danes,&rdquo;
p. 18), the Normans translated into &ldquo;Grandham,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Granham,&rdquo; as we find it in the Conqueror&rsquo;s
survey in Domesday Book; and which was sometimes further
curtailed into &ldquo;Graham,&rdquo; as we find a field in High
Toynton described as the &ldquo;24 acres towards
Graham.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Feet of Fines, Lincoln, 9, Henry III., No.
52, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1224&ndash;25, quoted
&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q,&rdquo; vol. iii., pp.
245&ndash;6).&nbsp; And not only was Greetham (or Grandham) held
in demesne, <i>i.e.</i>, as a manor, but, like the neighbouring
Bolingbroke, being connected with Royalty, it became also
designated an &ldquo;Honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a Chancery Inquisition post mortem (21 Henry VII., No. 122)
taken after the death of Henry Dawson, it is stated that &ldquo;4
messuages, &amp;c., in Tetney are held of the Lord the King, as
of his Honour of Bullingbroke&rdquo;; and in almost similar
terms, in a Chancery Inquisition post mortem, of the same King,
No. 124, taken after the death of William Quadring, Esq., it is
stated that he &ldquo;held a messuage in Irby, of the Lord the
King, as of his Manor of Greetham, parcel of his Duchy of
Lancaster.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Domesday Book it is stated that
certain lands in the Manor of Bilsby, near Alford, are
&ldquo;held of the Manor of Grandham&rdquo;; Greetham apparently
not in either of these cases being regarded as an Honour.&nbsp;
But in an Inquisition post mortem, of John Asfordby, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1499, it is stated that the manor of
this same Bilsby, with Westhalgarth, is &ldquo;held of the Lord
the King, as of the Honour of Greetham.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, even as
early as Domesday (1080), lands are enumerated as belonging to
&ldquo;Grandham,&rdquo; lying in Langtune (by Spilsby),
Hacberdineham (Hagworthingham), Salmundby, Tedforde, Brinkhill,
Wingsby, and Clachesby Pluckacre, in all amounting to 33
carucates, or close upon 4,000 acres (3960).&nbsp; And, to shew
the wealth of the manor at that date, <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>compared with some others in the
neighbourhood, while Scrivelsby is given in Domesday as of the
value of &pound;14, and Horncastle at &pound;44, Bolingbroke is
put at &pound;40, but Greetham at &pound;60, and it is further
tallaged, <i>i.e.</i>, taxed at &pound;70.&nbsp; It was the
&ldquo;caput Honoris,&rdquo; or head, of the Lincolnshire Barony
of Hugh de Abrincis, or Avranches, the Conqueror&rsquo;s nephew,
surnamed Lupus, or The Wolf, from his many deeds of
violence.&nbsp; He was Earl of Chester, having the whole of
Cheshire assigned to him, except a small portion belonging to the
Bishop; and his royal uncle further granted to him, nine manors
in Berkshire, seven in Yorkshire, ten in Dorset, thirty-two in
Suffolk, and twelve in Norfolk, twenty-two in Leicester, and
about a score in Lincolnshire, besides smaller numbers in other
counties, and sokes and berewicks beyond counting.&nbsp; Earl
Lupus in his later years, attempted to atone for the
irregularities of his early life, by becoming monk in his own
Abbey of St. Werburg, at Chester.&nbsp; Later, the estates which
he held, reverted to the crown, and were, in part, granted to the
Earl of Lincoln, who was created Duke of Lancaster.&nbsp; His
daughter and heiress, married the 4th son of King Edwd. III., who
also, through his wife, became Duke of Lancaster, and was father
of Henry of Bolinbroke, afterwards Henry IV.&nbsp; After various
vicissitudes, the Honour and much of the very extensive soke of
Bolingbroke, became merged in the Crown; and, in part, still
remains the property of the Sovereign, the King having among his
titles still the Palatine Dukedom of Lancaster.&nbsp; The
fortunes of Greetham were more varied.&nbsp; It is impossible,
from the sources of information available for these notes to give
all the successive steps in the tenure of this manor, and of its
numerous and valuable appurtenances; or to give the connection,
if any, between successive owners.&nbsp; Fixity of tenure was by
no means a feature of those times, the power of the Sovereign was
almost absolute, and demesnes were seized by him, forfeited,
retained, granted anew, or disposed of for money, according to
the royal caprice, or the exigencies of his purse, in a most
arbitrary fashion.&nbsp; To show the precarious nature of tenures
held &ldquo;in capite,&rdquo; or &ldquo;in chief&rdquo; from the
Sovereign, we will mention one or two cases, taken
haphazard:&mdash;Edmund of Woodstock, 2nd son of Edwd. I., was
beheaded by Edward III., in the 4th year of his reign.&nbsp; He
had been granted the manor <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>of Greetham only 3 years before
(Dugdale&rsquo;s &ldquo;Baronage,&rdquo; vol. ii., p. 93).&nbsp;
At a previous period, Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, died seised
of the manor of Greetham.&nbsp; In the ordinary course of events,
the manor would have remained a possession of his daughter,
Alice, countess of Lincoln.&nbsp; Yet a Lancaster Record (class
xxv. R. 8), shows that Alice granted the manor to Hugh Dispenser,
16 Ed. II., and, he being a favourite of that King, we can hardly
doubt that the grant was a forced one.&nbsp; The historian Speed
informs us that, the Earl of Lancaster being attainted, the elder
Dispenser obtained a grant of some of the Lancaster property in
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; But in 1327, the younger Dispenser, the Hugh
above-named, the favourite of the King (Edward II.), fell into
disfavour, and a commission was appointed to enquire what goods
and chattels he possessed at the time of his banishment, in his
manors of Greetham, Thorley, Wainfleet and Brattleby.&nbsp; He
also held at that time, as shown by other records, lands in
Thornton, Roughton, Wilksby, Wood Enderby, Partney,
Mareham-le-Fen, &amp;c., and a manor in Scrivelsby.&nbsp; But he,
in his turn being banished, the attainder of the Earl of
Lancaster was revoked, and the property once more reverted to the
Lancaster family, in the person of his brother and successor,
Henry of Lancaster.</p>
<p>Truly the history of many a noble family of those times was a
moving and vivid commentary on the words of Holy Writ, &ldquo;Put
not your confidence in Princes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a list of military tenures (temp. Henry II.), while Norman
d&rsquo;Arcy, the Earl of Britanny, Alan de Percy, Stephen of
Albemarle, and several others, are named as holding various of
the manors in the neighbourhood, the Duke of Lancaster is given
as &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; of Greetham, Winceby and Hameringham
(&ldquo;Old Lincolnshire,&rdquo; by G. H. Burton, 1885, vol. i.
pp. 214&ndash;215).&nbsp; These, as we have seen, had been very
extensively added to, and further additions are named in various
records, some of which we will here give, as they show the
importance of Greetham.&nbsp; We should, however, observe that
because a great Baron held the manor of a demesne, it did not at
all follow that he owned the whole parish.&nbsp; This applies to
Greetham, as follows:&mdash;In an Assize Roll, at Lincoln, of 9
Edward I. (<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1280), a certain
Robert de Kyrketon, and his wife Beatrix, demand (and their claim
is admitted), certain rents of lands in &ldquo;Askeby next
Gretham (<i>i.e.</i>, <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Ashby Puerorum), Stavenesby
(<i>i.e.</i>, Stainsby), Bag-endreby and Little Gretham,&rdquo;
at a time when the Earl of Lancaster was lord of the manor.&nbsp;
An Inquisition of the Earls of Kent (2nd son of Edwd. I.,
beheaded. 4 Edward III. and at that time, as we have already
stated, holding the manor of Greetham), shows that lands in
Huttoft, Theddlethorpe, Wainfleet and Thoresby, as well as in
Bratoft and Mablethorpe (the two latter also given in Domesday),
were held under the manor of Greetham in addition to those
already named in the more immediate neighbourhood, of Bratoft and
Mablethorpe, appurtenances of Greetham at the time of Domesday
(1080) and continued to be so as late as 1552 (&ldquo;Linc. N.
&amp; Q.&rdquo; vol. iv. p. 122).</p>
<p>We will now look at the evidence of Greetham being an
&ldquo;Honour&rdquo; as well as a manor.&nbsp; The two properties
of Bolingbroke and Greetham, eventually, after various changes,
passed under the same ownership; both forming parts of the Duchy
of Lancaster.&nbsp; The Honour of Bolingbroke, was also called
the Honour of Richmond, from the Earl and Countess of that name,
the parents of the future Henry IV. of England, the only
Sovereign of England born in Lincolnshire.&nbsp; The manor of
Greetham is sometimes called the &ldquo;Honour of
Lancaster,&rdquo; <i>par excellence</i>, but it is quite clear
that Greetham is then intended, and though united, even under one
common management, they were legally regarded and treated as
distinct &ldquo;Honours.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a bailiff&rsquo;s
account of Rents of Assize, and of Court Perquisites (now in the
possession of John Sykes, Esq., F.S.A., of Doncaster, quoted
&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; iii. p. 82), it is specified,
that beside the Bolingbroke Rents, there &ldquo;is nothing,
because the others are given in the accounts of the Honour of
Lancaster,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> of Greetham; and the same
distinction is observed in the &ldquo;Perquisites of
Courts,&rdquo; where we find, &ldquo;13s. 6d. from two views and
Courts of the Honour of Bolingbroke, and one view and Court of
Honour of Lancaster&rdquo; (Greetham).&nbsp; Although the two
accounts were thus kept distinct, the Court Rolls of the year (10
Richard II), show that the Court of both Honours were at that
time &ldquo;holden together by order of Thomas Hungerforde,
Knight, Chief Steward.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the earlier of these
Records, Greetham was necessarily described merely as a manor,
because it was not yet connected with royalty, and therefore was
not then an Honour.&nbsp; But in later documents it is frequently
referred <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>to as such; for instance, in a Chancery Inquisition post
mortem taken at Alford, 22 July <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1506 (21 Henry VII. No. 121), we
find it stated that &ldquo;Thomas Rygge Gentylman, held certain
lands, with their appurtenances, in Westyrkele and Langton, of
the lord the King, of his Honour of Greteham&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Journal of Architect. Society,&rdquo; 1895, pp.
42&ndash;3).&nbsp; It is further stated that &ldquo;John Afforby
held the manor of Bilsby, of the Lord the King, as of the Honor
of Gretham, of his Duchy of Lancaster&rdquo; (quoted
&ldquo;Lincs. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; iv. p. 108).</p>
<p>Besides the places already named as belonging to the demesne,
or soke, of Greetham, I find &ldquo;Lecheburne&rdquo;
(<i>i.e.</i> Legbourne), Swaby, Elgelo (<i>i.e.</i>, Belleau),
Claythorpe, Totele (<i>i.e.</i>, Tothill), Withern, Haugh,
Calceby, Dalby, Dexthorpe, and many more.</p>
<p>Enough has, however, been said to shew the extent of the soke,
or jurisdiction, of the lords of Greetham, and its rank as an
&ldquo;Honour&rdquo; connected at different periods with
royalty.</p>
<p>Its subsequent history, down to the present century, is almost
a blank.&nbsp; The Manor, although still, in our Directories (see
Weir, Kelly, etc.), styled &ldquo;a parcel of the Duchy of
Lancaster,&rdquo; has dwindled much in importance; and the
inhabitants are apparently becoming fewer.&nbsp; In 1821 they
numbered 148, in 1843 they were 152, in 1883 they were 147, in
1891 they had dropped to 131.&nbsp; The total acreage is
1250.&nbsp; A few stray notices, connected with by-gone Greetham,
are the following:&mdash;In Gibbon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Early Lincoln
Wills&rdquo; (p. 67), Richard de Ravenser, Archdeacon of Lincoln,
by Will, dated &ldquo;15 May, 1385,&rdquo; bequeaths a legacy to
Walter de Gretham.&nbsp; Who the latter was, we have no means of
learning.&nbsp; The Ravensers were of a good family.&nbsp; In
Maddison&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wills of Lincolnshire&rdquo;
(1500&ndash;1600), p. 26, No. 68, we find that Richard Newcomen,
of Nether Toynton, by will, dated &ldquo;3 Sep., 1540, left xx
pence to the poor of Greetham.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Newcomens were
among our oldest families, originally seated at Saltfleetby,
where their names appear in the registers, for many
generations.&nbsp; One of them, John Newcomen, &ldquo;of
Sallaby,&rdquo; was involved in the Lincolnshire Rebellion of
1536, along with Monsons, Massingberds, Heneages, Maddisons, and
many other members of leading families.&nbsp; This Richard,
above-named, settled at Low Toynton early in the 16th century,
and his grandson Samuel, <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>&ldquo;of Nether Toynton,&rdquo;
married Frances, daughter of Thomas Massingberd, of Bratoft Hall,
Esq., M.P.&nbsp; Several of them are mentioned in the
Herald&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lists of Gentry&rdquo; in 1634 and 1666, as
residing at Hagnaby, Withern, Bag Enderby, &amp;c.&nbsp; They
have now disappeared from Saltfleetby and &ldquo;their place
knoweth them no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their pedigree is given in the
&ldquo;Architectural Society&rsquo;s Journal&rdquo; for
1897.&nbsp; Another old record (from the same source) is
&ldquo;John Dighton of Minting, by Will dated 17 December, 1606,
leaves to Thomas Page of Greetham vj &pound;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who
Thomas Page was is unknown; but the Dightons were a well known
family, of mercantile origin at Lincoln; the founder having
served as Mayor and Sheriff; one of them, Thomas resided at
Waddingworth, another at Minting; the chief member, Robert, owned
and occupied the Hall at Stourton Magna, of which traces still
remain in mounds and moats.&nbsp; He also was involved in the
Lincolnshire rebellion.&nbsp; A daughter of Dighton of Stourton
married Edward Clinton, Esq., of Baumber, who afterwards became
Earl of Lincoln, and his descendants Dukes of Newcastle, whose
burial place, for some generations, was at Baumber.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The fashion of the world changeth&rdquo; the Dightons are
gone, the Clintons, renovated in blood, remain.</p>
<p>A tradition remains to this day, that Thomas Wentworth, Earl
of Stratford, in the reign of Charles I., and one of his
Sovereign&rsquo;s most faithful adherents, owned the manor of
Greetham.&nbsp; I cannot find any positive proof of this; but it
seems not at all unlikely, since a lease dated 14 Nov., 1685, was
granted to Sir William Wentworth, Knight, of Ashby Puerorum, who
was a son of Sir William Wentworth, who fell at Marston Moor,
fighting for Charles I; and from him descended the first Earl of
Stafford, of the second creation. <a name="citation69"></a><a
href="#footnote69" class="citation">[69]</a>&nbsp; It is proved
by the award that Thomas, Earl of Stafford was Lord of the Manor
in 1785.</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>We pass
on to the present century.&nbsp; About the year 1830, John
Fardell, Esq., of Lincoln (who represented that City in
Parliament for a brief period, being unseated on petition) became
owner, by purchase, of the Manor of Greetham, the rest of the
parish, except the Rectory farm of 48 acres, being purchased by
the late Mr. Robert Dennis, who built in 1830, a commodious
residence, Greetham House, where his two daughters now
reside.&nbsp; The manor, and about half the parish, was sold by
the Fardell Trustees to F. Wormall, Esq., whose present
representative is his grand-daughter, Lady Garden of Templemore
Abbey, co. Tipperary; whose father was Colonel Valentine Baker,
one of a family distinguished as sportsmen, travellers, and
soldiers.&nbsp; We have said that the road, or street, on which
the village houses cluster, was probably originally Roman; and
some years ago, the neck of a Roman urn was found near it.&nbsp;
Along this road, to the North is a quarry in which many ammonites
and other fossils are found, in the gravel lying above the white
clay.&nbsp; The age of &ldquo;Praise God Barebones&rdquo; and his
Puritanical allies, has long since passed away; but something of
the Puritan Spirit seems to survive in the names of the
villagers, given in the registers, which date from 1653.&nbsp; My
informant had herself known, within recent years, the names
Mordecai, Naomi, Keziah, Solomon, and Bridget shortened into
Briggy.&nbsp; There are also some curious field names.&nbsp; A
boggy field is called the &ldquo;Waddles&rdquo;; a similar field
in the almost adjoining parish of Salmonby is called
&ldquo;Wallows,&rdquo; both probably referring to a slough of
mire, and the awkward ducklike gait involved in traversing
it.&nbsp; A grass field is named &ldquo;Thunker,&rdquo; as
locally pronounced, which may embody the Norse Thing-garth, or
Council enclosure of the great hamlet.&nbsp; Another meadow is
named &ldquo;Kirtle,&rdquo; probably the Kirk-dale; while two
fields, one ploughed and the other meadow, are called &ldquo;the
Gousles,&rdquo; which Mr. Streatfeild (&ldquo;Lincolnshire and
the Danes,&rdquo; p. 174.) considers to mean the first slopes of
the Wolds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gaut,&rdquo; or &ldquo;gout&rdquo;
(go-out) means an outlet from a drain; and throughout the whole
range of the Wolds, there are numerous springs, issuing from
their base, not uncommonly possessing medicinal properties.&nbsp;
Greetham is situated on the first spur or projection, of the
Wolds in this locality, and these gousles may have been the <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>goutsleys, or
meadows, in which were the sources of local springs.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;In East Kirkby, at the foot of the Wolds, is a
field named Goutscroft.</p>
<p>There is also a field, named &ldquo;Cross Close,&rdquo; from
which the poor receive a yearly dole of 10s., bequeathed by
Elizabeth Somersby, in 1733.&nbsp; Here is a name which would
seem to embody ancient history.&nbsp; We can picture to
ourselves, the Saxon &ldquo;rude forefathers of the (great)
hamlet,&rdquo; gathered round that sacred symbol, the village
cross, before a church existed, to listen to the itinerant man of
God, awakening in their hearts a simple faith in a welcome
Saviour.&nbsp; These fields all, or most, of them lie in the
western part of the parish, the property of the Misses
Dennis.</p>
<p>Of the Church, dedicated to All Saints, little can be
said.&nbsp; It is a poor fabric, of Spilsby sandstone, with
square wood-framed windows, one in each side and end.&nbsp; A
&ldquo;three-decker&rdquo; pulpit, reading desk, and
clerk&rsquo;s seat, square pews, a west singing gallery, a very
meagre rood screen of apparently modern poor carving, all painted
wainscot colour.&nbsp; The roof a flat, white-washed ceiling
inside, is covered externally over the nave with lead, which,
from the decay of the supporting timbers is now almost flat, and
probably not in a very safe condition.&nbsp; The chancel roof is
slated and pointed.&nbsp; The font is plain octagonal, with
octagonal shaft, and square basin, within the bowl being a pewter
christening basin, with date &ldquo;1821.&rdquo;&nbsp; The single
bell hangs in a shabby bell turret, surmounted by a cross.&nbsp;
A slab records the death of a former Rector, the Rev. Thomas
Jesset, in 1837.&nbsp; The inscriptions on the grave-stones in
the churchyard would imply that the inhabitants are long-lived,
and the place healthy, as it should be, from its elevated and
well-drained position.&nbsp; The Rector has a good residence,
built in 1852.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Addendum</span>.&mdash;The above remarks
on the Church were written in the year 1900.&nbsp; We have much
pleasure in adding, in the year 1903, that the present Rector,
the Rev. T. Hoole, has succeeded in effecting a thorough
restoration of the old fabric, at a cost of about &pound;1,650,
towards which sum, the Misses Dennis, of Greetham House,
contributed &pound;500 each.&nbsp; The Architect was Mr. Hodgson
Fowler, of Durham; the contractors for the <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>work were
Messrs. Bowman &amp; Co., of Stamford.&nbsp; The only features of
interest in the former mean structure were a 13th century cross,
and doorway, and the south respond of the chancel arch.&nbsp; The
restored fabric has been constructed in harmony with this
respond.&nbsp; It is throughout of a simple, but effective, late
15th century design.&nbsp; The chancel, vestry, bell-turret, and
porch are new, and the screen has been restored; the nave has new
windows, a well-repaired roof, and new flooring, all the internal
fittings being of oak.</p>
<p>In the course of the work, other features of interest were
discovered, namely, the responds of a south aisle, a north door,
and a Norman entrance into a former tower.&nbsp; All these were
effectively utilised by the architect, with his accustomed skill,
and now the Church, though small, is large enough for the parish,
and a worthy edifice for divine worship, a result which must be
gratifying to all concerned.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Hagworthingham</span>.</h3>
<p>Hagworthingham is a considerable village, at a distance of 6
miles east of Horncastle, and 4&frac12; north-west of Spilsby, on
the road from Horncastle, <i>via</i> High Toynton and Greetham,
to Partney.&nbsp; Letters <i>via</i> Spilsby, arrive about 9
a.m.&nbsp; It has its own Post Office, Money Order Office, and
Savings Bank; the nearest telegraph office being at
Spilsby.&nbsp; Of this parish there are several notices in
Domesday Book.&nbsp; It is described as comprising six
manors.&nbsp; These were owned, at the date of the Norman
Conquest, by Thanes named Sivert, Elric, Swen, Swave,
Holinchetel, and Adestan.&nbsp; The Conqueror apparently removed
all these original proprietors, to provide for his own
followers.&nbsp; Few places shew to a greater degree than this
parish the insecurity of tenure which marked those times of
trouble, transition, and lawlessness, when might was right.&nbsp;
The survey of the country, made by order of the Conqueror, in
Lincolnshire in 1085, was called by the Saxons &ldquo;Domesday
Book,&rdquo; because it recorded their &ldquo;doom,&rdquo; or
their almost universal expropriation from their rights, in favour
of the Normans, who flocked into the country with William.&nbsp;
But the &ldquo;doom&rdquo; was not confined to the Saxon.&nbsp;
The Norman intruder, in many cases, found his possessions even
less secure than had been that of those <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>whom he
superseded, and the Norman Lords of these demesnes succeeded each
other with such rapidity, that, at this distance of time, it is
beyond our power to trace their connection, in every case, with
each other, or the causes of the changes.&nbsp; Doubtless, in
many instances, having acquired possession through violence to
others, violence again led to the confiscation of what they had
acquired.&nbsp; The first-named of these is Alan, Earl of
Britanny, on whom the Conqueror had conferred his daughter
Constance in marriage.&nbsp; Famed for his valour and martial
spirit, he had held an important command at the Battle of
Hastings; and for his services the Conqueror conferred upon him,
firstly, all the lands in the North Riding of Yorkshire, forming
the district called Richmondshire, which had belonged to the
powerful Saxon Earl Edwin, who was now dispossessed.&nbsp; From
this gift he derived the title of Earl of Richmond, as well as of
Britanny.&nbsp; Dugdale tells us that, altogether he held, by
grant from the Conqueror, 450 Manors, 101 of these being in
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; He seems however, in himself, to have been
not unworthy of so great a position; since, though so great a
warrior, the Chronicler, Ordericus Vitalis, states, that he was
&ldquo;ever studious for peace, a great lover of the poor, an
especial honourer of the religious&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;his
death, without issue created no little sorrow to all good
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was one of the first Norman Lords of
Hagworthingham.&nbsp; He was succeeded by his brother, also named
Alan.&nbsp; His chief residence, probably, being in Yorkshire,
when not in attendance on the King, he was represented at
Hagworthingham, by his vassal, Eudo, who occupied his land here,
to the extent of 3 carucates (or 360 acres), with dependents, in
whose hands were 5 carucates (or 600 acres) more.&nbsp; Before
proceeding to speak of other Norman Lords connected with this
place, let us notice the name itself of the parish.&nbsp; It has
3 elements: &ldquo;Haugh,&rdquo; (says Streatfeild,
&ldquo;Lincolnshire and the Danes&rdquo;), &ldquo;is low, meadow
land, bordering on a stream, and frequently overflowed&rdquo;; a
kindred form, &ldquo;Hagi&rdquo; he says also means a meadow. <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a>&nbsp; Anyone standing in <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>the
churchyard at Hagworthingham will see below him westward, just
such a low-lying meadow, traversed by a beck.&nbsp; The second
element in the name is &ldquo;Worthing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we seem
to have the Saxon &ldquo;Weorthig,&rdquo; which enters into many
a place-name as &ldquo;Worth&rdquo;; (compare Waddingworth, and
Benniworth in the neighbourhood); which is derived from the old
Saxon &ldquo;Warian,&rdquo; to ward or protect.&nbsp; Hence these
two elements mean the warded, or fenced, meadow, and
&ldquo;Ham,&rdquo; the last element, also is Saxon, and means a
place <i>hem</i>med in; but especially the residence, the
&ldquo;home,&rdquo; or the collection gathered round the one
house, now forming the &ldquo;hamlet.&rdquo;&nbsp; What could
give a more speaking description of the locality?&nbsp; It is the
homestead, and afterwards the residences of the villagers
gathered round it, whose position was on the higher ground,
because they wished to be above the low-lying enclosed meadow,
liable to be flooded by the brook, which runs through it, when
swollen by the rain.&nbsp; Even in these days of drainage
universal, the fox-hunter, in crossing that grassy valley, may
still find his steed &ldquo;boggled&rdquo; in the slough of
quagmire.&nbsp; In connection with this we may mention, that even
in modern times, this dampness has not been forgotten.</p>
<p>In a note to Chap. ii. vol. i. of Smiles&rsquo; &ldquo;Lives
of Engineers,&rdquo; it is stated that, when Dr. Whalley was
appointed to the Rectory of this parish, it was with the singular
proviso, that he should not reside in it, as the air was fatal to
any but a native (Letters and Correspondence of T. S. Whalley,
D.D.)</p>
<p>Another Norman soldier, named in Domesday as having a grant of
land in Hagworthingham from the Conqueror was Drogo de
Bevere.&nbsp; He was a Fleming by birth, and for his services in
the cause of the King had many lordships given him in
Lincolnshire and other counties.&nbsp; Among others, he had the
lordship of all Holderness, in which was Beverley, whence he had
the title of &ldquo;Terrius de Bevere.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
however of a very grasping and overbearing disposition.&nbsp; Not
content with the lordship of Holderness, he wished further to
seize lands given by the King to the Church of St. John at
Beverley.&nbsp; Camden says that, as a mark of royal favour, he
received in marriage the Conqueror&rsquo;s niece; but that he got
rid of her by poison; and then fled the country to escape the
punishment he deserved.&nbsp; <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>He was succeeded (his estates being
probably confiscated) by Odo, Lord of Albemarle, in Normandy
(Camden &ldquo;Britannia&rdquo; p. 742, Ed. 1695.)</p>
<p>To this Drogo was granted all the land in Hagworthingham,
which at the conquest had belonged to the Saxon Thane, Adestan,
including &ldquo;a hall, with sac and soke&rdquo; (or the right
to hold a court of justice for the trial of misdemeanours), with
8 villeins occupying considerable lands under him, and a mill of
the value of 18d. yearly.&nbsp; As his chief residence, when not
in attendance on the King, would probably be in Holderness, he
was here represented by one Robert, who was his vassal.</p>
<p>Another name mentioned as having property in this parish, is
Gozlin, son of Lambert, of whom little is known.&nbsp; This was
one of the 222 parishes in the county which had a church before
the Conquest; and Domesday Book states that he had the church
here, as well as a mill; but as it is added that &ldquo;the
soke&rdquo; (or jurisdiction) belonged to Gilbert de Gaunt, the
latter was evidently the superior lord.&nbsp; Gozlin had lands in
39 parishes in Lincolnshire, besides those in other counties; but
Gilbert de Gaunt had 113 Manors in this county, besides 41 in
other counties.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned that, on the flight of Drogo de Bevere,
after poisoning the Conqueror&rsquo;s niece, his estates were
transferred to Odo, Earl of Albemarle. <a
name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75"
class="citation">[75]</a>&nbsp; Accordingly we find the old
record, Testa de Nevill, p. 336. (<i>Circa</i> 1213), stating,
&ldquo;the Earl of Albemarle&rdquo; holds of the King (land) in
Hagworthingham, which Gilbert de Langton holds, as his
vassal.</p>
<p>About the same time the same old record states that the Earl
of Chester, besides other neighbouring possessions, held land of
the King in Hagworthingham, which the same Gilbert de Langton
held under him, as his vassal.&nbsp; This Earl was the only son
of Hugh d&rsquo;Abrincis (or Avranches), one of the most
important among the followers of the Conqueror, who was his
uncle.&nbsp; William gave to him numerous manors in this and
other counties, and especially the earldom of Chester.&nbsp; He
was surnamed Lupus, or the Wolf, for his daring deeds.&nbsp; It
was supposed that he was granted the county of Chester, that he
might restrain the <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>incursions of the neighbouring Welsh people, the
stubborn descendants of the old Britons; and this he did with a
vengeance, for, in conjunction with Hugh Montgomery, Earl of
Shrewsbury, he took the Isle of Anglesey from the Welsh.&nbsp;
Later in life, to make up for his tyrannous proceedings, he
became a monk of the Abbey of St. Werberg, of his own
establishment in Chester, and died there, in 1101.&nbsp; The Earl
of Chester held in Lincolnshire about a score of manors, besides
more than that number in Leicester, 32 in Suffolk, many in other
counties, and the whole of Cheshire.&nbsp; At this stage the
successive, or contemporary Lords of these manors become too
complicated a tissue to unravel here.&nbsp; Some of the manors
became merged in the superior manor of Richmond or Bolingbroke;
some, in that of Greetham.&nbsp; The Earl of Chester enfeoffed
before his death, William de Hardyshall, of certain land in
Hagworthingham, where his descendant resided in the 14th
century.&nbsp; A Gilbert de Langton held land here as a vassal of
Alan de Mumby; his son John, held the same lands under a de
Quincy.&nbsp; Hawise de Quincy, Countess of Lincoln in her own
right, had a daughter Margaret, who married John de Lacy, and the
de Lacies thus became Earls of Lincoln.&nbsp; At one period,
members of two different families were at the same time Earls of
Lincoln.&nbsp; After a succession of steps, John of Gaunt became
Earl of Lincoln, and ultimately Duke of Lancaster, and held many
of these manors.</p>
<p>Walter de Gant gave land in Hagworthingham to Bardney
Abbey.&nbsp; The Abbot of Bardney (&ldquo;Placito de
Warranto,&rdquo; p. 409), claimed the right to have a gallows in
Hagworthingham, as well as in Edlington and other places.&nbsp;
Other owners were Laurence de Dikeby, who died 1270, Robert de
Altomonte, 1274, William de Saxill, in 1280.&nbsp; Gilbert de
Hagworthingham is named in an Assize Roll (No. 478, John <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1202), Walter de Hagworthingham and
his son Philip, are named in an Assize Roll, 5 Ed. III.
1331.&nbsp; In the 14th century the Cupledyke family had land in
Hagworthingham, <i>viz.</i>, Roger de Cupledyke, who died 1324,
and Alexander who died, 1335.&nbsp; In the 15 century, Thomas
Blunt held a manor here, of the Duchy of Lancaster, dying in
1468. <a name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76"
class="citation">[76]</a>&nbsp; The great family of Welles, <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>also
connected with the Dymokes, acquired lands here, which were
forfeited after the battle of Loose-coat field, when Sir Robert
Welles was attainted and executed at Doncaster, for espousing the
Lancastrian cause, 1470.&nbsp; In the next century the old county
family of the Hansards held a manor here, by Knight&rsquo;s
service, of the Honour of Bolingbroke.&nbsp; Sir William Hansard
died 1520, leaving as his heir his granddaughter Elizabeth.&nbsp;
Robert Marbury, in 1545 died, seized of a third part of a manor
in this parish, which he left to his son William.&nbsp; Humphrey
Littlebury, of East Kirkby, died Nov. 3rd, 1558, seized of a
manor here, which was connected with the superior manor of Herby
(probably Hareby, and equivalent to the Honour of Bolingbroke),
which he held of the Queen (Elizabeth) by fealty.&nbsp; He also
held another manor here, of the Queen&rsquo;s manor of Greenwich,
which had belonged to Bardney Abbey; the gift, as stated above,
of Walter de Gaunt.</p>
<p>John Littlebury, of Hagworthingham, Esq., by will, dated 20
June, 1535, requests that he may be buried in the parish Church
&ldquo;before our Lady of the Rood.&rdquo;&nbsp; He seems to have
been a man of large property, for he bequeaths &ldquo;to my wife
&pound;40, due to me from Mr. John Hercy; &pound;4 of land in
Somersby, Tetford, Skegness and Orby, to bring up my children in
their nonage.&rdquo;&nbsp; This she is to have for life; and then
Somersby and Tetford are to go to his son George and his heirs
male; Skegness and Orby to his son Peter and heirs male, and
failing them, to his son Humphrey, and his heirs.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
sheep gate called Thorpe in the Mires (I leave) to my wife for
her life, and then to my son Humphrey and Ursulay his wife,
according to the indenture between me and Mr. Hercy.&nbsp; To my
three daughters, my brother Humphrey Myssendyne 10s. a year for
life, out of my copyhold held of Lord Willoughby.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His wife is to have the &ldquo;putting in of the priests at
Langton,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, the presentation to the benefice for
her life, and after her death, the &ldquo;first avoidence of one
priest&rdquo; is to go to his son Humphrey, the other to his <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>son
Thomas.&nbsp; To his son Thomas his lands in Kealcotes.&nbsp; To
his wife he leaves &ldquo;my copyholds held of Lord Willoughby;
and the farm of my son Langton, as long as the lease
lasteth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also &ldquo;if my wife be in decay in her
widowhood, I will that she give no peny to her daughters, of the
&pound;40 that is appointed to every of them, and if they be not
rewled by her in their marriage they are to have nothing.&nbsp;
Item.&nbsp; I will all my children be contente with the lands

by Sir John Lyttlebury my grandfader&rsquo;s fader.&nbsp; I
appoint my brother John Eland supervisior, and my wyfe
ex&rsquo;x.&rdquo;&nbsp; Witnesses, William Langton Gent, Sir
Malmaduke Myssendyne and Sir Richard Cheles, of Ashby
Puerorum.&nbsp; Various other wills show that Thomas Littlebury
had lands at Hagworthingham in 1589, that Humphrey, of East
Kirkby, held land in Hagg in 1568, and that Margaret Littlebury,
of Stainsby, held land there in 1582.</p>
<p>The will of John Gedney, of Bag Enderby, mentions his lands in
Hagg in 1535.&nbsp; The Gedneys were an old family in this
neighbourhood.&nbsp; In the church at Bag Enderby, there is a
stone mural monument, commemorating Andrew Gedney and Dorothy his
wife, with their two sons and two daughters kneeling before
prayer desks, date 1591.&nbsp; There is a slab of John Gedney in
the floor, date 1535. <a name="citation78"></a><a
href="#footnote78" class="citation">[78]</a>&nbsp; Andrew Gedney
married Dorothy, daughter of Sir William Skipwith, of South
Ormsby, in 1536.&nbsp; Within recent years Arthur P. H. Gedney, a
cousin of the writer, owned Candlesby Hall, near here.</p>
<p>The will of John Gannock, of Boston, shews that he also was a
landowner here, in 1583.</p>
<p>In 1572, Francis Bountague, died seized of a manor in
Hagworthingham, which he held of the King, as of the manor of
Greetham, of the Duchy of Lancaster.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>John
Littlebury, gent., of Hagworthingham, by will dated 27th March,
1594, bequeaths to Mr. William Wray, &ldquo;the ring that it
pleased my lady, his mother, to give me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lady
Wray, would be the wife of Lord Chief Justice Wray (temp.
Elizabeth), whose residence was at Glentworth&mdash;he died in
1592; they were an old Durham family.&nbsp; The fine house at
Glentworth continued to be the family residence of the Wrays,
until Sir Cecil Wray, Bart., erected &ldquo;Summer Castle&rdquo;
at Fillingham, in 1760, so called from Esther Summers, Lady
Wray.&nbsp; Mr. John Littlebury also leaves to Sir George St.
Poll, &ldquo;my half part of the hawks,&rdquo; with bequests to
other relatives.&nbsp; Sir G. St. Poll or St. Paul, or Simpole,
was a member of a good Lincolnshire family, their chief residence
being at Snarford.&nbsp; Mr. John Saintpole was compulsively
mixed up with the Lincolnshire Rising in 1536.&nbsp; The
grandson, George, was created a Baronet in 1611.&nbsp; They were
connected with the Hansards, already mentioned as having land in
Hagworthingham.</p>
<p>Yet one more will of a Littlebury concerns us.&nbsp; John
Littleburye (28 Sep. 1611), requests to be buried in Hag
church.&nbsp; He leaves to the poor 20s.; to his son John, his
land in Raithbye, for his life, and for his &ldquo;bringing up in
learning.&rdquo;&nbsp; &pound;100 to his daughter Bridgett,
&ldquo;soe that shee be ruled by mye wief her mother in
marriage,&rdquo; with &pound;200 to be paid her when
married.&nbsp; &ldquo;To my wief Anne the lease of Orbye from Mr
Massingberd, alsoe my stocke and cattle, with all my plate and
furniture.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the children are young he confirms an
indenture previously made with Richard Gedney, and others, to act
as trustees.</p>
<p>Sir John Langton, of Langton, by will dated 25 Sep. 1616, also
left to the poor of Hagworthingham 10s., and like bequests to
other places.</p>
<p>(These particulars are taken from &ldquo;Lincolnshire
Wills,&rdquo; by Canon Maddison).</p>
<p>Among &ldquo;Final Concords,&rdquo; there are agreements about
lands in Hagworthingham, under date 26 Oct. 1208, between Thomas
de Winceby and Gilbert and Osbert of Hag, under date 20 Jan.
1213&ndash;14, between Mary, the wife of Hugh, son of Robert,
Ernald de Dunham acting for her and Hugh de Harrington,
appertaining to her &ldquo;reasonable dowery;&rdquo; and under
the same date between the same Mary, and John de Bardney, as to
land called &ldquo;Sigwardes Croft,&rdquo; in
&ldquo;Hacworthingeham, which Mary surrenders to <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>John de
Bardney and his heirs,&rdquo; he for this giving her 2 marks.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned that in the 14th century, Roger de
Cupledyke who died 1324, and Alexander, who died in 1335 had land
in Hagworthingham.&nbsp; We also find that John Copledyke of
Harrington, by will dated Palm Sunday, 1408, left to his sons
lands in Hagworthingham, and other places.</p>
<p>In the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. a certain John Parker
of this place became somewhat notorious as a religious and
political turncoat.&nbsp; He made a public declaration &ldquo;of
the manner in which he had been drawn from the service of God to
become a Papist,&rdquo; dated 12 December, 1580; but in 1605,
evidence was taken against him at Enderby, as to his making
certain seditious speeches, and he was pronounced to be a
Recusant (&ldquo;Domestic State Papers&rdquo; James I. vol. xv.
&ldquo;Architect. S. Journal&rdquo; 1865 p. 55).</p>
<p>At the present day the only one of the old families of
proprietors in this parish is the Rev. Alan Cheales above named,
descended from Sir Richard Cheales who lived as far back as
1535.&nbsp; At the present time Earl Manvers is Lord of the
Manor; Sir Henry D. Ingelby, Bart., the trustees of the late Rev.
W. A. Bathurst, and the Wingate family are the principal
landowners, the larger portion belonging to Mr. Cheales.&nbsp; We
now proceed to the Church.&nbsp; It is beautifully situated on
the slope of a steep hill commanding a view along a deep valley
to the west, of fertile soil varied by copse and whin; and it is
surrounded by a beautifully kept God&rsquo;s acre.&nbsp; The
Church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, consists of tower, nave,
south aisle and chancel.&nbsp; In the tower are 8 melodious
bells.&nbsp; The Church was carefully restored and largely
rebuilt in 1859; but still retains several of its original Early
English features.&nbsp; The tower, of green sandstone, being much
decayed, had new belfry windows inserted, but still retains its
patched appearance by a mixture of brick: the green and red tints
blending harmoniously.&nbsp; Towards the west end of the north
wall is one of the old Early English pilaster buttresses; and at
the east bay of the same wall is an original low-side
window.&nbsp; Within, the aisle arcade of four bays is supported
by circular-shafted pillars, having rudely-designed caps; the
arches above being not <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>sufficiently massive to correspond,
and their junction clumsy.&nbsp; These low arches produce a sort
of &ldquo;dim religious light.&rdquo;&nbsp; The aisle itself is
entirely new; as are also the seats and fittings generally.&nbsp;
The early English font has a plain octagonal bowl, supported upon
a central shaft, and unengaged subsidiary shaftlets.&nbsp; The
east windows are modern, but may be reproductions of the
old.&nbsp; That in the east end (of three lights) is filled with
coloured glass by Wailes, in memory of the Cheales family.&nbsp;
There is a modern brass on the north side of the chancel,
commemorating the Rev. Henry Cheales sometime Vicar of Burton
Pedwardine, &ldquo;and for sixty-six years a landowner of this
parish,&rdquo; 1870.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;The Parish Registers contain a large numbers of
names of this family.&nbsp; The earliest mention of them is in
the Church Book Topographical Collection of Sir Joseph Banks,
1786, where Hugh Cheales is given as one of the Churchwardens, 25
Henry VIII. (1534).</p>
<p>The window in the north wall is by Clayton and Bell, that in
the south wall by Powell.&nbsp; They commemorate the families of
the late Rector the Rev. F. Pickford, and his wife&rsquo;s
relatives, the Listers of Burwell Park; one also being in memory
of the late Prince Consort.&nbsp; &ldquo;The whole effect,&rdquo;
says the late Bishop Suffragan, Dr. E. Trollope, one of our
greatest authorities, &ldquo;is most pleasing and
appropriate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gervase Holles the antiquarian says
that, when he visited the Church (temp. Chas. I.) there was in
the Chancel this fragmentary inscription, &ldquo;Hic jacet . . .
Redilston quondam Rector istius Ecclesi&aelig;.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
says also, &ldquo;on a gravestone of blue marble in ye body of ye
Church is pourtrayed in brasse one in compleate armour, bearing
upon ye manches of his coate of arms, on either side, 2
crescents.&nbsp; Between his feet a right hand couped.&nbsp; The
rest is defaced.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Harleian MSS., No. 6829.)&nbsp;
The benefice was formerly in the gift of the Bishop of Ely (see
Ecton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thesaurus&rdquo; p. 188); the patron is now
the Bishop of Lincoln.</p>
<p>In the Registers were formerly some curious entries of
&ldquo;Briefs,&rdquo; or Royal Letters, issued for various
charitable objects, among 65 which were publicly read in Church
in the 14 years from 1653 to 1667, 24 were for relief in cases of
loss by fire; others were for various purposes; one <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>being
&ldquo;For the Church of Lithuania being under persecution&rdquo;
(1661). <a name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a></p>
<p>Walter de Gaunt gave the manor, benefice, and six oxgangs of
land, and &ldquo;a view of frankpledge&rdquo; in this parish to
Bardney Abbey (Dugdale&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monasticon,&rdquo; 1682, p.
143).</p>
<p>In sinking a well in 1897, on the property of Mr. Cheales in
this parish, there were found at a depth of about 45ft. fragments
of &ldquo;Brinkhill gold&rdquo; and fossilized wood.&nbsp; The
gold has also been found in the churchyard.&nbsp; It is
pronounced, chemically, to be a form of silicate of
aluminia.&nbsp; Iron pyrite is also found, abounding in small
fossils.&nbsp; The rectory is now held by the Rev. G. R.
Ekins.&nbsp; The rectory house was built in 1841, a very
commodious residence, at a cost of about &pound;2000, by the late
Rector the Rev. F. Pickford, the memory of whose family still
remains in the parish, and many miles round it, as &ldquo;a sweet
smelling savour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a rent charge of &pound;8 for the poor paid out of
the estate, about 700 acres, of the Cheales family.</p>
<p>The Rev. William Dales also in 1667 left land, the rent of
which was for the poor and the bell-ringers.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Hameringham</span>.</h3>
<p>Hameringham is about 4 miles from Horncastle, in a south-east
direction, the road passing through Mareham-on-the-Hill.&nbsp;
The marriage register dates from 1744, those for burials and

&ldquo;Hundred of Hamringeheim&rdquo; is mentioned, and
&ldquo;Count Richard,&rdquo; probably the Norman Earl of Chester,
is said to hold there eleven carucates and four oxgangs, or
nearly 1400 acres, and Gilbert Fitz Gocelin had four oxgangs, or
about 60 acres (&ldquo;Old Lincolnshire,&rdquo; vol. i. pp. 213,
214).</p>
<p>In the year 1208 Henry, son of Geoffrey, granted to Ralph,
Abbot of Revesby, and his successors, an oxgang of land and a
messuage in Hameringham; the said Ralph giving to the said Henry
20s., in consideration thereof.</p>
<p>In the year 1529, Jane Sheffield, widow, of Croxby, in her
will dated 7 January, refers to a deed of feoffment, dated 4
June, 8 Henry VIII., whereby Sir John Sheffield, Parson of
Hameringham, and others are feoffed of certain lands, for her
life; Sir John Sheffield and Alexander Amcotts, Gent., being
supervisors.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Lincolnshire Wills,&rdquo; page 6, No.

<p>In 1540 John Angevin of Ashby by Horncastle, by will, dated 10
Oct. makes his wife Margaret, executrix, and confirms to her

a different hand, &ldquo;I Robert Awngeven agreed to this
wyll.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Angevins disappear in the 17th century;
but one of the family held land in Hameringham in the reign of
Henry VIII. (&ldquo;Lincolnshire Wills,&rdquo; p. 28, No.
72).&nbsp; By will, dated 20 April, 1545, Robert Angevin, of
Langton by Horncastle, leaves his land in Hameringham to his son
William.&nbsp; (Ibidem p. 36, No. 96). <a

<p>Among the Revesby charters is one, of date 1198, whereby
Richard I. grants and confirms to the monks of Revesby certain
lands in Hameringham, Enderby, and elsewhere (Dugdale v.
456).</p>
<p>By a deed in the reign of Richard I., or John, William, son of
Gaufrid, clerk, of Hameringham, gives to the monks of Revesby 9
acres of arable land in Hameringham, a meadow called
&ldquo;Baldvinegaire <a name="citation84a"></a><a

<p>By a deed early in the 13th century Symon, son of Hugo, of
Dunsthorpe, gives to the monks one toft in Hameringham, and 10

Pesedalegate, <a name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b"
class="citation">[84b]</a> free from all claims.</p>
<p>In the reign of Henry III. Juetta, daughter of Alan, of
Hameringham, gave to the Abbey of Revesby, 4 acres of arable
land, for the purpose of gate-alms.&nbsp; In the reign of Edwd.

in Tuluse, Hameringham, and elsewhere, to the monks of Revesby,
on condition that they pay to him and his heirs annually
8<i>s.</i>&nbsp; Alicia the daughter of William, son of Alward of
Hameringham, in the same reign, gave a half toft for the Revesby

the Court of Augmentations every Michaelmas, the duke&rsquo;s
title to date &ldquo;from March 1, in the 29th year of our reign
(1538).&rdquo;</p>
<p>[These different documents are among the Revesby charters,
printed by the late Right Honble. E. Stanhope, M.P.]</p>
<p>The benefice of Hameringham was formerly charged with a
pension of 6s. to the Prior of Bullington.&nbsp; In the early
part of the 18th century, the Chaplin family would seem to have
been proprietors here, as Mr. Thomas Chaplin presented to the
benefice in 1712 and 1720.&nbsp; The manor now belongs to the
Coltman family, who are also patrons of the benefice; and there
are several smaller proprietors.</p>
<p>Scrafield, which has now no church, is united to
Hameringham.&nbsp; Some of the communion plate is ancient, being
Elizabethan, the rest is modern, being presented by the late
Rector, Rev. Joseph Coltman.</p>
<p>Hameringham church, All Saints, stands appropriately on almost
the highest ground in the vicinity, so that the parishioners may
look, and wend, upward to it.&nbsp; It was restored by the
present Rector, the Rev. Brice Smith, in 1894, the architect
being Mr. Hodgson Fowler.&nbsp; It now consists of nave, chancel,
and south aisle.&nbsp; It has, doubtless, gone through
vicissitudes at various periods, as is evidenced by remains and
records.&nbsp; In 1800 there was no chancel in existence.&nbsp;
In 1820 a chancel was built by the then Rector, the Rev. Joseph
Coltman.&nbsp; There was at one time a much larger edifice, of
which the foundations were discovered by the present Rector, in
preparing for the restoration.&nbsp; The chancel arch is Early
English.&nbsp; The west window is modern, perpendicular in
style.&nbsp; In the north wall of the nave is one window,
perpendicular, of three lights, near the pulpit.&nbsp; The pulpit
is of plain oak, with the old hour glass frame still affixed to
it, and containing an ancient hour glass, recovered from a
villager.&nbsp; These remnants of the days of long discourses are
now very rare.&nbsp; There is still one in the church at Cowden,
near <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>Edenbridge, Kent.&nbsp; The arcade of the south aisle is
of the 13th century, renewed in the 14th century with Lincoln
stone.&nbsp; It consists of three bays, with two octagonal
pillars having carved capitals; the eastern-most support is a
circular, single, small shaft, apparently Norman, with carved
capital, different from the others; where the moulding of the two
eastern arches meet, the corbel is a King&rsquo;s head; these two
arches are considerably broader than the western one, which is
pointed.&nbsp; This western pillar is the original 13th century
one.&nbsp; The south wall is of the late 12th century, and the
south porch arch is the original.&nbsp; In the south wall are two
windows east of the porch, and one west of it, each having two
lights, and a quatrefoil above, style perpendicular.&nbsp; There
is a piscina near the door.&nbsp; The roof of the restored nave
is of modern pitch pine.&nbsp; The chancel roof is considerably
below the chancel arch.&nbsp; It is apparently of wood, and has
formerly been divided into panels.&nbsp; The chancel is so long,
that the communion table is placed 7 or 8 feet west of the east
wall, and the space behind, shut off by drapery, forms a
vestry.&nbsp; The east window, in perpendicular style, is of 3
lights, with six smaller lights above, within the arch.&nbsp; The
font is a very old and interesting one, octagonal, on an
octagonal shaft; the devices, quatrefoils, &amp;c., on the faces
of the bowl are much mutilated, those on the shaft are
perpendicular mouldings on 5 sides, and on the three other sides
are grotesque figures, much mutilated, the centre one being
winged, and supposed to represent St. Michael.&nbsp; It stands on
a plain oblong slab.&nbsp; There is one good medieval bell, the
other being the &ldquo;Sanctus bell,&rdquo; re-cast in the
Jubilee year 1887, as it had become cracked.&nbsp; The entire
church is built of Spilsby green sandstone, faced in the porch
with red Dumfries stone.</p>
<p>The visitor to Hameringham from Horncastle, looking south and
westward, will see some beautifully wooded scenery, around
Scrivelsby Park, Haltham, and beyond towards Revesby,
Tattershall, &amp;c. the view extending even beyond the Fens;
with the spires of Heckington and other churches towering up in
the dim distance, twenty miles or more away, a most delightful
prospect.&nbsp; Conspicuous among these objects is the
magnificent tower, with its lantern, of what is commonly called
Boston Stump.</p>
<h3><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span><span
class="smcap">Hareby</span>.</h3>
<p>Hareby is situated about 7 miles, in an easterly direction
from Horncastle, is about 1 mile west of Bolingbroke, and
4&frac12; miles from Spilsby.&nbsp; From the first place it is
approached by the old Roman road from Horncastle to Waynflete, as
far as the cross-roads at Lusby, turning to the right for
half-a-mile and then to the left.&nbsp; It is a small parish, of
less than 40 inhabitants, and comprising about 740 acres.&nbsp;
Letters, <i>via</i> Spilsby, arrive at 8.30 a.m.&nbsp; The
nearest money order office is at Bolingbroke, the nearest
telegraph office at Spilsby.&nbsp; Hareby Manor House, the
property of Messrs. Ramsden and Taylor, stands on a steep
hill-side, commanding extensive views over Bolingbroke, West
Keal, and southward, far away to the waters of &ldquo;The
Wash.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has been said that the name of Hareby, and
probably also that of Eresby&mdash;the older name of
Spilsby&mdash;is derived from the hares, which formerly abounded
on these hills and valleys of the Wolds, the &ldquo;South
Wolds,&rdquo; as we might here call them, of Lincolnshire. <a
name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87"
class="citation">[87]</a>&nbsp; We are only able to recover
fragmentary particulars, &ldquo;disjecta membra,&rdquo; of the
past history of this parish.&nbsp; From Domesday Book we gather,
that, like Miningsby, Bolingbroke, and many other neighbouring
parishes, it was once the property of Ivo Taillebois, through his
marriage with the Lady Lucia, heiress of the Saxon princely
family of the Thorolds, whom the Conqueror bestowed upon
him.&nbsp; They were married in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1072, and on his death, without male
issue, in 1114, the Lady Lucia married Roger de Romara, who thus,
through her, became Lord of Bolingbroke, with other manors in the
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>soke of
that demesne.&nbsp; At that period the parish would seem to have
been more populous than it is at the present day; the Domesday
survey, giving the acreage as four carucates (or 480 acres),
rateable to gelt; adds, that thirty-three socmen, five villeins
and five bordars had another four carucates, and 100 acres of
meadow.</p>
<p>The Lady Lucia, marrying as her 3rd husband the Norman noble,
Ranulph, he delivered some of her estates to the King, Henry I.,
in return for the dignity of the Earldom of Chester.&nbsp;
Against this, William de Romara, her son by her late husband,
Roger de Romara, protested, but in vain.&nbsp; Some years later,
however, Henry I. restored to him some of his mother&rsquo;s
property, and made him Earl of Lincoln; and later still, by the
exchange of some lands in Normandy with Robert de Tillot, he
acquired the lordships of Hareby, Hundleby and Mavis
Enderby.&nbsp; By his wife Maud, daughter of Richard de Redver,
he had a son William, who married Hawise, daughter of Stephen,
Earl of Albemarle.&nbsp; The last of the Romaras dying without
male issue, the property passed to Gilbert de Gaunt, who married
his daughter, who also succeeded to the Earldom of Lincoln.&nbsp;
Robert de Gaunt forfeited the property by rebelling against King
John, and the estates were conferred upon Ranulph de Meschines,
surnamed de Blundeville (<i>i.e.</i>, of Oswestry), Earl of
Chester, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1100&ndash;1120.&nbsp; He died with issue, but assigned to
Hawise, one of his sisters, the Earldom and manors.&nbsp; She
married Robert de Quincy, son of the Earl of Winchester, whose
daughter Margaret, married John de Lacy, a descendant of the
Barons of Pontefract.&nbsp; His son Edmund, left issue Henry (and
others), who, dying without surviving issue, bequeathed his
property to the heirs of Edmund Plantagenet; after various
changes the property again came to a Gaunt, John, afterwards Duke
of Lancaster, and father of Henry of Bolingbroke, who later on
succeeded to the throne as Henry IV. <a name="citation88"></a><a
href="#footnote88" class="citation">[88]</a>&nbsp; In the course,
however, of the these changes, Hareby, and some other manors, had
become separated from Bolingbroke, and had passed to the
Willoughby family, since we find that in the time of Edw. III.,
father of Henry of Bolingbroke, John Willoughby, held &ldquo;the
<a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>manors of
Wester Kele with Hareby, Lusby, Easter Kele, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Chancery Inquisition, 46 Ed. III. No. 78).&nbsp; The family of
Willoughby, although originally holding lands under the Becs, who
were lords of Spilsby, Eresby, &amp;c., &amp;c., subsequently
inter-married with that family, and thus succeeded to some of
their property, and were the ancestors of the family of the
present Lords Willoughby d&rsquo;Eresby, and eventually acquired
very large possessions in these parts, much of which they still
retain.</p>
<p>We find, however, at different periods, various other parties
holding lands in, or connected with, Hareby.</p>
<p>In a Revesby Charter (No. 28, collection of the late Right
Hon. E. Stanhope), conveying the right of lands in East Kirkby to
Revesby Abbey (temp. Henry II. or Richard I.) the first witness
is Alan, Dean of Hareby, others being, Aschetill, priest of Keal,
Alan, priest of Asgarby, &amp;c.</p>
<p>By another Charter (No. 53 temp. Richard I. or John), Henry
Smerehorn of East Kirkby, gives his home-born
(&ldquo;nativum&rdquo;) servant, Robert, son of Colvan, with all
his chattells to Revesby Abbey, and receives in return &ldquo;one
silver mark from Peter, the monk of Hareby.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
monk of Hareby would therefore seem to be a nominee of the Abbot
of Revesby.</p>
<p>And this connection is confirmed by another charter (No. 92,
temp. Henry III.), by which the Abbot and monks of Revesby lease
certain lands in Stickney to Bricius, son of Roger, clerk of
Stickney, to which deed the witnesses are Walter of Hareby, at
that time Prior of Revesby; Reginald the cellarer, John of
Moorby, Alan of Horncastle, &amp;c., so that it would seem the
former priest, or dean, of Hareby, was promoted to the Priorate
of Revesby.</p>
<p>By another charter (No. 129, temp. Ed. I.), Alan son of
Richard atte Grene (or, as we should now say, Richard Green)
gives certain lands in East Kirkby to the Abbey, the monks paying
in return, &ldquo;one farthing a year&rdquo; to Alan, son of
William, son of Roger Palmer, of Hareby, and his heirs, at the
feast of St. Botolph, for all claims on the land.</p>
<p>By another charter (150 B.), lands in Hareby, Bolingbroke,
West Keale, &amp;c., formerly belonging to Revesby Abbey, are
conveyed by Henry VIII., on the dissolution of the monasteries,
to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Another
name, once well-known in the neighbourhood, is found connected
with Hareby, in the 15th century.&nbsp; In a Chancery
Inquisition, 32 Henry VI., 1453, taken at Horncastle, the
witnesses on oath are Walter Tailbois, Esq., William Dalison, of
Hareby, and others.&nbsp; The Dalisons (doubtless originally
d&rsquo;Alencon), were a very old Lincolnshire family, seated at
Laughton, probably of Norman extraction.&nbsp; In the 16th
century Sir Francis Ayscoughe a member of another very old county
family <a name="citation90a"></a><a href="#footnote90a"
class="citation">[90a]</a> married, as his 2nd wife, Elizabeth,
daughter of Robert Dighton, Esq., of Stourton, and widow of Sir
William Dalyson.</p>
<p>In 1635 Robert Bryan died, at Bolingbroke (March 7th) seized
of lands in Bolingbroke and Hareby, which he held of the Crown, a
captain Bryan being governor of the Castle in the time of the
Commonwealth, and a few years later, (1663), a grant of leases in
reversion of demesne land was made in favour of the widow of
Thomas Blagge, groom of the bedchamber <a
name="citation90b"></a><a href="#footnote90b"
class="citation">[90b]</a> (&ldquo;Architect. S. Journal,&rdquo;
1865, p. 57).</p>
<p>We have mentioned this manor as formerly being the property of
the Plantagenets.&nbsp; Of this there exists a curious piece of
evidence.&nbsp; One Alan de Cuppledyke, <a
name="citation90c"></a><a href="#footnote90c"
class="citation">[90c]</a> was appointed by Edward II. governor
of Bolingbroke castle, and his steward&rsquo;s accounts still
exist.&nbsp; In one passage he says that &ldquo;the open woods of
Hundleby, Kirkby and Hareby Thorns cannot be agisted (modern
Linc. &lsquo;gisted,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i>, let to be stocked with
cattle), on account of the <i>new coppice</i>, planted by the
late Earl,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, Thomas Plantagenet, the recent
owner, the King&rsquo;s cousin, but who had forfeited his
property, by stirring up a rebellion.&nbsp; This probably may be
said to be the only wood in England which can be proved to have
been planted by a Plantagenet (&ldquo;Arch. S. Journ.&rdquo;
1865, p. 43).</p>
<p>The Littleburies, whose chief residence in this neighbourhood
was Stainsby House, in the parish of Ashby <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Puerorum,
formerly owned land in Hareby.&nbsp; Humphrey Littlebury, of East
Kirkby, in his will, dated 1 Sep., 1568, among other property
mentions land in Hareby. <a name="citation91"></a><a
href="#footnote91" class="citation">[91]</a></p>
<p>Another old family connected with Hareby was that of the
Skynners.&nbsp; Henry Skynner of Bolingbroke, by his will of date
29 May, 1612, leaves to his daughter Judith, all his copyholds in
Harebie, and &pound;100 when she is married, or 21 years of age;
to his brother, Sir Vincent Skynner, knight, and his heirs, he
bequeaths certain lands in Harebie, and other places, with the
advowson of the parsonage of Harebie, &ldquo;all of which I
lately purchased of him, on condition that he pay to my executor
the sum of &pound;60, within six months of my decease, which sum
I have already paid for my said brother, unto Margery Neale of
Horncastle, deceased, or else this gift is utterly void, and I
give it to my daughters . . . I have made surrender of all my
customary messuages, lands, &amp;c., in Bullenbroke and Harebie,
into his Majestie&rsquo;s hands by Vincent, in the name of one
Grave, in the presence of Richard Smyth, gent., and
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; This testator was the son of John Skynner,
and brother of Sir Vincent Skinner, of Thornton Curtis.</p>
<p>Mention has been made of Robert Bryan as owning land in
Hareby, in 1635.&nbsp; Members of the same family would seem to
have had property there nearly a century later, as John Bryan was
patron of the benefice in 1754, and united it to that of
Bolingbroke.&nbsp; In 1555 King Philip and Queen Mary presented
Gilbert Skroweston to Hareby; but in 1779 the patronage of the
united benefice had passed to Matthew Wildbore, Esq.&nbsp; In
1834 the patron was Earl Brownlow; in 1836, C. Bosanquet, Esq.;
and in 1863, Sir John W. Smith, Bart.; after him the trustees of
the late G. Bainbridge, Esq., held the patronage, which now has
passed to C. S. Dickinson, Esq.&nbsp; The owners of the estate
are now Messrs. Ramden and Taylor, and it is managed for them by
their relative, G. Mariner, Esq.</p>
<p>The church, dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul, was rebuilt
in 1857&ndash;8, at a cost of about &pound;450.&nbsp; It consists
of nave and chancel, with belfry, having one bell, the <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>fabric being
constructed of brick.&nbsp; Sir J. W. Smith, the then patron,
built the nave, and the chancel was built by the then Rector, the
Rev. E. Stanley Bosanquet.&nbsp; The east widow, of coloured
glass, with the crucifixion, was erected in memory of William
Bernard Wingate, a late owner, by members of his family.&nbsp;
There is another coloured window in the south wall of the
chancel, without inscription, but probably erected by the Wingate
family; and there is a marble tablet in the north wall of the
nave, in memory of the late owner of the estate, Frederick Tooth,
Esq., of Sevenoaks, Kent.&nbsp; The register dates from 1567.</p>
<p>Hareby Manor House is a handsome, substantial structure,
standing on a slope, looking towards Old Bolingbroke, and
surrounded by extensive gardens and good farm buildings.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Hatton</span>.</h3>
<p>Hatton lies about 7&frac12; miles from Horncastle, to the
north-west, and about 4 miles south-east of Wragby; being about
&frac12; a mile eastward of the high road between those two
places.&nbsp; Letters, <i>via</i> Wragby, the nearest money order
and telegraph office, arrive at 10 a.m.&nbsp; The register dates
from 1552.&nbsp; There are also entries relating to this parish,
from 1695 to 1799, in the Baumber register.&nbsp; The name
Hatton, as a parallel to Hatcliffe, Hatfield, Hatfield Chase,
&amp;c., doubtless means a &ldquo;ton,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>,
&ldquo;town,&rdquo; or protected enclosure, on an open
&ldquo;heath&rdquo;: pointing to a time when the neighbourhood
was more or less a wild tract; and when the neighbouring Wragby
(from Vargr, a wolf, or outlaw), was the haunt of wild beasts, or
the no less dangerous human robber.</p>
<p>The Church, dedicated to St. Stephen, described by Weir in his
&ldquo;History of Lincolnshire&rdquo; (vol. i. p. 296, Ed. 1828),
as a small building, possessing no claim to attention, and by
Saunders (vol. ii. p. 71, Ed. 1834) in nearly the same terms, was
at that time in the gift of the well-known, somewhat eccentric,
but popular member for Lincoln, Colonel Sibthorpe; the Rev. H. W.
Sibthorpe being Rector.&nbsp; In 1863 it was in the gift of G. W.
Sibthorpe, Esq., and in 1869 in that of Coningsby C. Sibthorpe,
Esq., being <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>then held by the Rev. C. E. Jarvis.&nbsp; The latter
resigned in 1891, since which time it has been held by the Rev.
W. T. Beaty-Pownall, who has a good rectory house, built in 1871,
at a cost of &pound;1,300 the late Mr. James Fowler being the
Architect.&nbsp; It does not appear to have been long in the
patronage of the Sibthorpe family, as in 1711 the patrons were
Sir Richard Wynch, Bart., and Rebecca Wynch, widow; while in
1750, and again 1780 Sir Robert Lawley, Bart, presented.&nbsp;
The trustees of W. H. Sibthorpe, Esq., are first-named as patrons
in 1824.&nbsp; In the calendar (No. 1), of Institutions to
Benefices, from 1540 to 1570 preserved in the Alnwick Tower, Old
Palace, Lincoln (&ldquo;Architect. Soc. Journal,&rdquo; 1897)
fol. 22b. 176, we find &ldquo;William Mershall, clerk, pres. by
W. Dighton of the City of Lincoln, gent., to the church of
Hattone, vac. by the resignation of Sir William Smith; inst.
Vicar, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1550.&rdquo; <a
name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93"
class="citation">[93]</a>&nbsp; The Dightons were originally a
mercantile family, of Lincoln, who filled the offices of Mayor
and Sheriff, and amassed fortunes.&nbsp; One of them, Robert,
became owner of Old Stourton Magna Hall, the moated remains of
which can still be traced in a field about a mile to the west
beyond the Stourton Parva plantations.&nbsp; A daughter of Thomas
Dighton of that place, married Edward Clinton of Baumber, who
afterwards became Earl of Lincoln.&nbsp; In the parish Register
of Stourton Magna is the entry &ldquo;Alice ye wife of Rob Diton
was buried ye 14 Jany. 1688,&rdquo; and as there are no later
entries of the name, this Robert was probably the last to reside
there.&nbsp; There were other <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Dightons at Waddingworth and
Horkstow.&nbsp; We find, however, earlier notices of Dightons
residing in Hatton.&nbsp; In 1544 by his will, dated 1 May,
&ldquo;John Dighton of Hatton&rdquo; requests to be &ldquo;buried
in the churchyard of St. Elwold in Hatton.&rdquo;&nbsp; He leaves
a bequest for his brother, &ldquo;Robert Dighton, parson of
Haltham,&rdquo; and the residue to his wife, Agnes, his
executrix; his two fathers-in-law, Thomas Dighton and William
Chatterton, being &ldquo;supervisors.&rdquo;&nbsp; He evidently
died early in life.&nbsp; As to the expression &ldquo;the
churchyard of St. Elwold,&rdquo; there seems to be no explanation
forthcoming.&nbsp; Possibly there was a chapelry in the parish,
with separate burial grounds.&nbsp; In 1606 we find another John
Dighton, residing at Minting, who, by his will, dated 28 Dec. of
that year, leaves 40s. to the poor of Baumber, Minting, and
Hatton.&nbsp; Other names in connection with this parish are as
follows:&mdash;Among Lincoln Wills is one made by &ldquo;Roger
Holmes, of Hatton, gent.&rdquo; dated 15 May, 1611, in which he
makes various bequests of no particular interest.&nbsp; In 1613
John Wharfe of Wickenby, by will dated 18 Sept., leaves to his
sons lands in Hatton, which he had on a mortgage, from his
father-in-law Smythe.&nbsp; And in 1616, by will dated 12
November, &ldquo;Heneage Smith of Hatton,&rdquo; leaves
&ldquo;lands in Hatton for a schoolmaster.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says
that he received nothing from his son-in-law, J. Wharfe, for the
mortgage, but that, nevertheless, he leaves certain moneys for
his (J. Wharfe&rsquo;s) sons, because they are his grandsons.</p>
<p>(N.B.&mdash;These notices are from &ldquo;Lincolnshire
Wills,&rdquo; by Canon Maddison.)</p>
<p>The Church of Hatton was re-built in 1871; entirely of brick,
except the stone facings.&nbsp; It consists of a nave, chancel,
and small spire on the south side of the chancel, containing one
bell.&nbsp; Its chief features are as follows:&mdash;the east
window, of coloured glass, has three separate trefoiled lights,
in memory of Waldo Sibthorpe, Rector, who died, 14 Nov. 1865, the
subjects are, in the centre, the Crucifixion; in the northern
light, the Agony in the Garden; in the south light, the
Resurrection, &ldquo;Noli me tangere.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the north
chancel wall are two brass tablets, one recording that &pound;100
was left by Mary Esther Waldo Sibthorpe in trust to the Rector,
for the poor of the parish; the other, that &pound;100 was given
by Charles Edward Jarvis, in trust to the Rector, for the benefit
of the parish.&nbsp; In the north wall is one two-light Early <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>English
window, and one single-light window in the same style.&nbsp; In
the south wall is one single-light window, the vestry door, and
organ chamber, over which stands the tower and spire.&nbsp; In
the north wall also is a credence table of stone, with trefoiled
arch.&nbsp; The east end is in the form of an apse.&nbsp; The
chancel arch, and that of the organ chamber, terminate in
elaborately foliated finials.&nbsp; In the nave, the pulpit is of
Caen stone, a device in one panel being a cross within a
quatrefoil, surrounded by a circular moulding.&nbsp; In the nave
north wall, near the pulpit are a pair of two-light windows, with
trefoils above; and westward is a three-light window with
quatrefoil above.&nbsp; In the south wall of the nave is one
two-light window, with two trefoils, and a circle above; and one
three-light window corresponding to that in the north wall.&nbsp;
The lectern is of oak.&nbsp; The font is of Caen stone, with
fluted bowl in eight partitions, and supported by eight round
columns.&nbsp; The sittings, for fifty, and the roof throughout,
are of pitch-pine.</p>
<p>The Rectory, close by, is a commodious and substantial
residence in good grounds.&nbsp; In a field to the south of the
gardens are remains of former stews, or fishponds, and two rather
large boulders, <a name="citation95"></a><a href="#footnote95"
class="citation">[95]</a> which have evidently been ice-borne,
and like many others in the neighbourhood, are of carboniferous
&ldquo;Spilsby&rdquo; sandstone of the Neocomian period.&nbsp;
The soil of the parish generally, is a heavy clay; and in a
brickyard adjoining the Horncastle and Wragby road, are numerous
ammonites and other fossils.</p>
<p>There is a yearly rent charge of &pound;6 left by Heneage
Smith, in 1616, for the education of poor children, which is paid
out of the estate of Coningsby C. Sibthorpe, Esq.; 14s. 2d. was
left by William Marshall, in 1557, for poor parishioners, to be
paid out of land at Minting, but this has fallen into
abeyance.&nbsp; Edmund Turnor, Esq., is lord of the manor but C.
C. Sibthorpe, Esq., owns the greater part of the soil.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Midge Inn,&rdquo; which has the reputation of formerly
being the haunt of the highwayman, who lightened the pocket of
many a traveller on the King&rsquo;s highway, is on the
Horncastle and Wragby road in this parish, which is in the soke
of Wragby.</p>

<p>This parish lies 4 miles north by west from Horncastle, on the
river Bain.&nbsp; Letters, <i>via</i> Horncastle, which is the
nearest money order office, arrive at 9.30.&nbsp; The Incumbent
is the Rev. E. S. Bengough, who has a commodious Rectory.&nbsp;
The register dates from 1579.</p>
<p>The Church is dedicated to St. Margaret.&nbsp; A previous
structure, erected in nondescript, &ldquo;Grecian,&rdquo; style,
in 1771 (a period when so many of the churches in the
neighbourhood were re-modelled in the worst taste), consisting of
nave, chancel, and low tower, with three bells, was re-seated in
1856, when additional accommodation was provided.&nbsp; A west
door, made of bog oak, from a large tree dug up, when the railway
line was made between Boston and Lincoln, was presented by the
Rev. E. Walter, Rector of Langton.&nbsp; The entire fabric was
restored in 1896, at a cost of &pound;1450, and re-opened in
January of that year, through the liberality and exertions of the
Rector, Rev. E. S. Bengough, aided by handsome donations from
Earl Manvers, the family of the late Rector, Rev. G. Thackeray,
and others.&nbsp; The tower was entirely re-built and the chancel
enlarged.&nbsp; A relic of a former medieval church was found in
the pavement of the nave, consisting of a slab, carved with two
quatrefoils, with shields in the centre of each.&nbsp; This was
placed in the wall of the chancel, above the east window.&nbsp;
The pulpit, of carved oak, was the gift of the family of the Rev.
G. Thackeray, the late Rector.&nbsp; The architect was Mr. W.
Scorer, of Lincoln.&nbsp; The bells, of the 18th century, bear
the names of the founders, Mears and Stainbanks, of London.</p>
<p>At the date of Domesday Book, the great Norman Baron, Ivo
Taylebois, owned land in this parish, as Earl Harold had done
before him.&nbsp; Baldric, one of the Earl&rsquo;s vassals, had
there one carucate, and two villeins, and two bordars, and seven
sokemen, who had two carucates, and half a mill, worth 7s.
yearly, and 30 acres of meadow.&nbsp; There were three carucates,
rateable to gelt.&nbsp; The manor, held by Edric, had six
oxgangs, also rateable to gelt.&nbsp; Its value, temp. Edwd. the
Confessor, was 60s., in Domesday 100s.</p>
<p>Among the gentry of Lincolnshire, enrolled in the List made by
the King&rsquo;s Heralds, at their visitation in 1634, was
Ambrose Shepard of this parish (Everard Green, F.S.A.,
&ldquo;Lincs. N. &amp; Q.,&rdquo; p. 105).</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>In
Liber Regis, the living was valued at &pound;17 8<i>s.</i>
6&frac12;<i>d.</i>, now at &pound;500; 423 acres being allotted
at the enclosure in lieu of tithes and the old glebe.&nbsp; In
1722 the benefice was in the gift of the Rev. Mr. Carr of
Newcastle-on-Tyne; after that the patronage was vested in
King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.</p>
<p>There is an endowed School, for master and mistress, founded
by Jane Dymoke, widow of the champion, in 1727, and endowed by
her in 1736, for teaching the children of the poor of the parish,
&ldquo;to read, write, spin, and card wool.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Commodious schoolrooms for boys and girls have been erected in
late years.&nbsp; Lands in Woodhall yield an income of about
&pound;110 a year.&nbsp; There is a rent charge of &pound;5 on a
farm in Asterby, and &pound;568 in consols.&nbsp; The whole
yearly income is about &pound;130, besides residence and 20 acres
of land for the master.&nbsp; Four almswomen receive 2<i>s.</i>
3<i>d.</i> weekly, with an allowance of fuel.&nbsp; Four
apprentices are provided for with a premium of &pound;10, and
&pound;3 a year for clothing, during the 7 years of their
service.&nbsp; The late Mrs. Baker, in 1848, also left the
interest of &pound;500 to be distributed in coals among the poor
of the parish.&nbsp; The living is now in the gift of
King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge; but by an Inquisition held at
Boston, 12 Henry VII. (<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1497)
it was found that Sir John Ratclyff, knight, besides considerable
other property in the county, was seised of the advowson of
Hemingby, and alternate advowson of Skyrbeck, but he being
attainted, in the 11th year of that King, his property passed to
Andrew Dymmock, as the Kings &ldquo;Solidat&rdquo;
(soldier).&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.,&rdquo; iv., p.
11.)&nbsp; In 1711 Leonard Smelt, Esq., presented to this
benefice; in 1722 the Rev. Mr. Carr, of Newcastle, gent.; and
King&rsquo;s College for the first time in 1768.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Kirkby-on-Bain</span>.</h3>
<p>Kirkby-on-Bain is a village larger than most of those in the
immediate neighbourhood, situated on the river Bain, between 4
and 5 miles from Horncastle, in a southerly direction, about 4
miles north-east of Tattershall, and rather less south-east of
Woodhall Spa, where are <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>the nearest railway station, money
order, and telegraph office, there being a post office in the
village.</p>
<p>It was a saying of one of our chief arch&aelig;ologists, that
&ldquo;anciently every local name had its meaning&rdquo;; and we
may extract more than conjectural history from the name,
Kirkby-on-Bain.&nbsp; The first syllable carries us back into a
distant past, earlier than the date of most of our written
records.&nbsp; As a rule, when the word &ldquo;Kirk&rdquo; forms
part of a place-name, it implies, not only the former existence
of a church in the locality (the name in Domesday is
&ldquo;Chirchebi,&rdquo;) but also of a still earlier, and
probably Druid, temple.&nbsp; The syllable &ldquo;Kir,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Ker,&rdquo; <a name="citation98a"></a><a
href="#footnote98a" class="citation">[98a]</a> with its plural
Kerrog, Kerig, or Curig (hence &ldquo;Church&rdquo;) means a
sacred circle, which was the form of the ancient British, or
Druid, place of worship, such as are still to be seen, on a large
scale, in the megalithic remains of Stonehenge near Salisbury,
and at Avebury near Marlborough, in Wiltshire; and, on a smaller
scale, in many a lonely spot among the hills in Wales and
Scotland, and on the continent, as far Palestine.&nbsp; These
remarks apply to many places in our own neighbourhood, as
Kirkstead, Kirkby Green, beyond the once sacred stream of the
Druids, the Witham, or Rhe, East Kirkby beyond Revesby,
&amp;c.&nbsp; We have 5 Kirkbys, and 2 Kirtons (Kirk-ton), in the
county.&nbsp; Thus we get a British origin for this parish; while
the name of the river, on which it is situate, is also British;
the word &ldquo;Ban,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;bright,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;clear,&rdquo; is found not only in the river Bain, but in
several other streams. <a name="citation98b"></a><a
href="#footnote98b" class="citation">[98b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>The
second syllable of the name Kirkby yields further
information.&nbsp; While the two contiguous parishes of
Kirk-stead and Kirk-by have the first syllable in common, in
their suffix, they differ, since &ldquo;stead,&rdquo; connected
with our word &ldquo;steady,&rdquo; is Saxon, meaning a settled
domicile; and &ldquo;by,&rdquo; is an old Danish word, (still
surviving in Scotland as &ldquo;byre&rdquo;) meaning the same. <a
name="citation99a"></a><a href="#footnote99a"
class="citation">[99a]</a></p>
<p>The Britons, therefore, have left their mark in the first half
of both these names, but from the second halves we gather that
the Saxons made their permanent residence in Kirkstead, whereas
in Kirkby, although they doubtless there also succeeded the
Britons, they were, in turn, supplanted by the Danes, who made
this place their &ldquo;byre,&rdquo; or &ldquo;by,&rdquo; with
three &ldquo;by-roads,&rdquo; or village roads, branching from
it.</p>
<p>In this connection we may also note, that &ldquo;Toft,&rdquo;
which is a farm name in the parish, is also a Danish word, and
this is another of their &ldquo;footprints on the sands of
time&rdquo;; while further we may observe, that those roving
invaders were called &ldquo;Vikings,&rdquo; because they first
frequented our &ldquo;viks,&rdquo; &ldquo;wicks,&rdquo; or
creeks; and there are geological indications, in the beds of sand
and gravel, in this parish, that the river Bain was, at one time,
much wider and deeper than it is in the present day <a
name="citation99b"></a><a href="#footnote99b"
class="citation">[99b]</a>; and so, we may well suppose, that, up
this &ldquo;ancient river,&rdquo; the river Bain, those Danish
marauders steered their way, from its mouth at
&ldquo;Dog-dyke,&rdquo; originally Dock-dyke, because there was a
Dock, or Haven, for shipping there (as the present Langrick was a
long-creek of the sea, a few miles beyond; the sea then coming up
from Waynfleet); and made their settlement here, from which they
ousted the Saxons, whose presence is implied in the name of the
hamlet Tumby, originally Tunne-by, which is, in part, a Saxon
appellation.</p>
<p>Thus, by the analysis of a name we are brought down from those
far-off, dark ages to within the range of historic times.&nbsp;
Kirkby is stated to be in &ldquo;the soke of <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>Horncastle,&rdquo; in a document of date 1327&ndash;8
(&ldquo;Lincolnshire N &amp; Q.&rdquo; vol. v., No. 44., p. 248),
but the local historian, Mr. Weir (&ldquo;Hist.
Horncastle,&rdquo; p. 310, Ed. 1828) says, that it had a
jurisdiction of its own, including Kirkstead, and even more
distant parishes, as Wispington, and Waddingworth. <a
name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a"
class="citation">[100a]</a></p>
<p>The Domesday survey of this county, made in 1089, by order of
William the Conqueror, and so named by the Saxons, because it
recorded the doom of many a Saxon Thane, ejected from his
possessions by Norman warriors, contains several notices of this
parish; and although at first sight they appear somewhat
conflicting, yet a careful study of them enables us to put
together something like a connected account of some of its former
proprietors.</p>
<p>First we may mention the Saxon owners, who were dispossessed
of their lands by the Normans.</p>
<p>One of these was Ulmar, who had 150 acres, charged with the
land tax, called &ldquo;gelt,&rdquo; which was about 2<i>s.</i>
to the carucate (or 120 acres); besides which he had 1&frac12;
carucates (180 acres), sub-let to smaller bond tenants, making in
all 330 acres.&nbsp; He had also in the adjoining parish of
Tattershall Thorpe, 240 acres, &ldquo;in demesne,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, in his own occupation, as Lord of the Manor, besides
360 acres sub-let to dependents.&nbsp; Ulmar was therefore what
we should call, &ldquo;well to do,&rdquo; a Saxon yeoman of
substance.</p>
<p>There were also two other Saxon owners in the parish, who
would seem, to some extent, to have been partners.&nbsp; Godwin
and Gonewate had between them 60 acres in Kirkby, charged with
the aforesaid payment of &ldquo;gelt,&rdquo; and 75 acres exempt
from it.&nbsp; They had also 360 acres in Tattershall Thorpe; and
separately, or together, they had lands in several other
parishes.&nbsp; Especially in Tumby, they owned 300 acres
rateable to &ldquo;gelt,&rdquo; and 360 acres more sub-let to
dependents.</p>
<p>Another part of this parish would seem to have been a separate
demesne, Fulsby, probably a contraction of Fugels-by, or the
homestead of Fugel. <a name="citation100b"></a><a
href="#footnote100b" class="citation">[100b]</a>&nbsp; Here, at a
later <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>period, there was a large residence, named
&ldquo;Fulsby Hall&rdquo; of which possibly there may be still
some traces in ponds and mounds, in a field in the middle of what
is still called &ldquo;Fulsby Wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toft Grange also would seem to have been another distinct
property; and was at a later date (as will be shown hereafter),
owned or occupied by a Dymoke.&nbsp; The term
&ldquo;Grange&rdquo; would imply that it was an appendage of some
Religious House; and an old charter of Richard I., now in the
Library of Revesby Abbey, shows that that Sovereign granted to
the Monks of St. Lawrence at Revesby, the Grange of Toft, <a
name="citation101a"></a><a href="#footnote101a"
class="citation">[101a]</a> with its appurtenances, a mill at
Fulsby, with lands in Tumby, Coningsby, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The greater part of Tumby was, as it is still, woodland, and
formed &ldquo;Tumby Forest,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tumby Chase,&rdquo;
of which old maps still show the trees. <a
name="citation101b"></a><a href="#footnote101b"
class="citation">[101b]</a></p>
<p>In a Close Roll, 5 Ed. IV. (1466), there is a reference to the
great wood, called &ldquo;Tumbi Wode,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tumbi
Chase&rdquo; (&ldquo;Ibiden,&rdquo; p. 131).</p>
<p>We have, thus far, three Saxon proprietors in this parish, who
were, in their day, men of substance; but the incoming of the
Norman was the Saxon&rsquo;s doom; and while Domesday Book says,
with pregnant brevity, that Ulmar, Godwin, and Gonewate
&ldquo;had,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> formerly owned, such and such
lands, it names the Normans alone as present proprietors.</p>
<p>In the case of Kirkby the accounts also of these Norman Lords
might seem, at first sight, somewhat conflicting.&nbsp; For
instance, Domesday Book gives Odo, Bishop of Baieux as owner of
this parish, or a large portion of it; but we turn over only a
few pages, and find it referred to as among the possessions of
William de Karilepho, Bishop of Durham.&nbsp; But &ldquo;hereby
hangs a tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Odo of Baieux was half brother of
William the Conqueror; being the son of Arlette, the concubine of
his father, Robert, Duke of Normandy, by a Norman <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Noble,
Herluin de Contaville.&nbsp; Odo&rsquo;s brother was created Earl
of Moretaine, his sister was the Countess d&rsquo; Aumale (which
in later times became Albemarle), and he was given by the Duke,
in 1049, the high position of Bishop of Baieux, in the now
department of Calvados, in Lower Normandy. <a
name="citation102a"></a><a href="#footnote102a"
class="citation">[102a]</a>&nbsp; On coming to England in the
train of the Conqueror, he was created Earl of Kent, Count
Palatine, and &ldquo;Justiciarius Angli&oelig;,&rdquo; and no
less than 439 manors were bestowed upon him, 76 of these being in
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; He was thus among the most powerful of the
Normans in this country; he was styled &ldquo;Vice-Lord of the
whole of England,&rdquo; and was said to be &ldquo;second only to
the King.&rdquo;&nbsp; But his greatness was his ruin.&nbsp;
Elated by his vast wealth, he aspired to the Papacy, and
collecting a great amount of treasure, he was about to set sail
for Rome, when William seized him and his treasure, and sent him
to prison in Normandy, confiscating his estate. <a
name="citation102b"></a><a href="#footnote102b"
class="citation">[102b]</a>&nbsp; Thus Odo&rsquo;s tenure of his
lands in Kirkby and elsewhere, was only brief; and there were
other grasping Norman followers of the Conqueror ready to step
into his shoes.&nbsp; One of these was the aforenamed William de
Karilepho, Bishop of Durham; who had been Abbot of St. Karilepho
in Normandy, but, coming over to England, was consecrated to that
Palatine See in 1082.&nbsp; Thus Kirkby again became the property
of a scarcely less powerful prelate than Odo; for the Bishops of
Durham have ranked high in the episcopate down to quite recent
times; but in early days they were not only bishops, but princely
nobles, whose influence almost rivalled that of the Sovereign;
and this prelate again was Chief Justice of England.&nbsp; An
indirect evidence of the Bishop of Durham&rsquo;s influence in
Kirkby is seen in the following circumstance.&nbsp; Both
Ecton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thesaurus,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Liber
Regis,&rdquo; state that the benefice of Kirkby formerly paid a
&ldquo;pension of 40<i>s.</i> to the Priory of St. Leonard at
Stamford.&rdquo;&nbsp; This would appear to have come about in
the following manner.&nbsp; Oswy, the Saxon King of Northumbria,
in the middle of <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>the 7th century of the Christian era, having conquered
the pagan King of Mercia, of which Lincolnshire formed a part, as
a thank-offering to God, gave to Wilfred, the friend and
instructor of his son Alchfrid, certain lands in Stamford, for
the maintenance of 100 Monks.&nbsp; Accordingly Wilfred, who
afterwards became Bishop of York, founded the Priory of St.
Leonard at Stamford; and, having received his own education at
the Monastery of Lindisfarne, in Holy Island, he gave the Priory
to that Religious House.&nbsp; At the time of the Conquest, the
Monks of Lindisfarne, were attached to the See of Durham, and
thus their dependency at Stamford came under the cognizance of
William de Karilepho; and as Lord of the Manor of Kirkby, he
charged this benefice with this contribution to the Priory.&nbsp;
Had the Monks of Lindisfarne not been plundered by the Danes, and
so driven to Durham, Kirkby would not have had this payment to
make; &ldquo;40<i>s</i>&rdquo; was, in those days a considerable
sum, the whole tithes of the benefice being only &pound;1
7<i>s.</i> 4&frac14;<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The buildings of the Priory
at Stamford, were plundered by the Danish rovers, but were
rebuilt by William de Karilepho, partly doubtless with money from
Kirkby, about the year 1082.&nbsp; On the dissolution of the
Monasteries, in the reign of Henry VIII. that King, who was
generally in need of cash, appropriated the temporalities of the
benefice of Kirkby, and so became patron of the living, which is
still in the gift of the Sovereign.</p>
<p>We now get another name of rank among the Normans connected
with Kirkby.&nbsp; Domesday Book says, &ldquo;Ilbert has here 1
caracate (120 acres), with 10 villeins (the lowest class of
bondmen), and 4 bordars (the higher class of bondmen), who hold
under him another carucate; also the site of a mill (a valuable
possession in those times), 12 acres of meadow (probably rich
grass land watered by the Bain), and 160 acres of woodland
interspersed with pasture,&rdquo; where the serfs would tend the
lord&rsquo;s herds of swine, which fattened on the acorns in
their season, and where he would harbour his deer, and other
animals of the chase.</p>
<p>In those times even a powerful noble did not disdain to be the
vassal of such a princely prelate as the great Bishop of Durham,
at the head of one of the three palatine counties in England; and
such was this Ilbert, or, as he was otherwise called, Hildebert
de Lacy.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>Coming to England with the Conqueror, he was granted by
William the manor of Pontefract, and 150 other lordships in
Yorkshire, 10 in Nottinghamshire, and 4 in Lincolnshire.&nbsp; In
several other parishes, <a name="citation104a"></a><a
href="#footnote104a" class="citation">[104a]</a> Kirkby being
among them, he also held lands, not absolutely &ldquo;in
demesne,&rdquo; as his own, but under the absentee Bishop of
Durham as lord paramount, to whom he paid a small yearly rent,
which was exacted from his Saxon dependents.&nbsp; This Ilbert,
or Hildebert, built the castle of Pontefract, <a
name="citation104b"></a><a href="#footnote104b"
class="citation">[104b]</a> and was one of the most powerful
nobles in Yorkshire.&nbsp; Another of his family, also Ilbert,
was a witness to the Charter of King Stephen, which secured the
ecclesiastical liberties of England; and another, John de Lacy,
became Earl of Lincoln, by marrying Margaret, daughter of Hawise
de Quincy, sister of Ranulph, Earl of Lincoln and Chester (<span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1232).&nbsp; Their son, Henry de
Lacy, held the same honours in the reigns of Henry III. and Ed.
I. <a name="citation104c"></a><a href="#footnote104c"
class="citation">[104c]</a>&nbsp; A John de Lacy was among the
signatories of the Magna Charta, and we may add that it is not a
little remarkable that, in this 20th century, the name of Ilbert
is yet to the fore, Sir Courtenay Peregrine Ilbert, K.C.S.I.,
C.I.E., &amp;c., being now Clerk of the House of Commons, and a
distinguished lawyer and scholar.</p>
<p>By a curious coincidence, Pontefract was in Saxon times known
by the name of Kirkby, and this name continued even in later
times; a charter of Ilbert&rsquo;s son, Robert, conveying lands
to the Priory of St. John at Pontefract, mentions them as being
&ldquo;de dominio de Kirkby,&rdquo; while another charter gives
them as &ldquo;de Pontefract&rdquo; (Camden&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; p. 729.)&nbsp; Thus Ilbert, Lord of
Kirkby-on-Bain, held two lordships in different counties, of the
same name.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>We
have yet another landowner named as connected with this parish,
of scarcely less note than Ilbert de Lacy.</p>
<p>As we have observed in our &ldquo;Records&rdquo; of other
parishes, Eudo, son of Spirewic, and Pinso, were two Norman sworn
brothers in arms, who came over with the Conqueror, and did him
such good service that William granted them &ldquo;the manor of
Tattershall with the hamlet of Thorpe and the towne of
Kirkeby,&rdquo; beside some 24 other lordships; Eudo to have
tenure directly from the King, and Pinso under St. Cuthbert of
Durham.&nbsp; They subsequently divided these possessions between
them, Pinso taking those further away, while Eudo seated himself
at Tattershall.&nbsp; On his death there, he was succeeded by his
son, Hugh Fitz Eudo, commonly called &ldquo;Brito,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;The Breton,&rdquo; who founded the neighbouring abbey of
Kirkstead, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1139.&nbsp; He had
in Kirkby 1 carucate (120 acres) of land &ldquo;in
demesne,&rdquo; with 8 acres of meadow and 80 acres of woodland
interspersed with pasture, very much as &ldquo;Kirkby Moor&rdquo;
is still.&nbsp; He had also in Tumby another carucate, in his own
occupation, with villeins and bordars, and two soc-men,
<i>i.e.</i>, free tenants, on 75 acres; also 20 acres of meadow,
one fishery and a half, two mills, and 370 acres of woodland,
forming the &ldquo;Tumby chase.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had also lands in
Waddingworth and Wispington, which were within the jurisdiction
of Kirkby; in the latter two parishes he halved the land with the
Bishop of Durham, who also (as we have seen) had a slice of
Kirkby.</p>
<p>With these several important personages connected with this
parish, it naturally also acquired a more important position than
the villages around, justifying the term &ldquo;town of
Kirkby,&rdquo; given to it in old records (Dugdale&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Baronage&rdquo; vol. i., p. 439).</p>
<p>Of subsequent owners of Kirkby, and its appurtenances, Tumby,
Fulsby, and Toft, we are not able to give a connected series, but
there is evidence enough to enable us to form fairly safe
conjectures, concerning several of them.</p>
<p>The ownership of the de Lacys continued, with one brief
interruption, for some generations.&nbsp; Hildebert was succeeded
by his son Robert Henry, but he, as Camden relates
(&ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; p. 712), taking part in the battle of
Tinchebray, Sep. 28, 1106, against Henry I., in favour of Robert,
Duke of Normandy, on the victory of Henry, was deprived of his
possessions, which were given to <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>another Norman, Henry Travers
(Dugdale&rsquo;s &ldquo;Baronage&rdquo; vol. i. p. 99), and
afterwards to Wido de Laval, who held them till the reign of
Stephen; when that King restored to the said Henry his
possessions once more.&nbsp; His two sons Henry and Ilbert dying
without issue, the estates in 1193 passed to their half sister,
on the mother&rsquo;s side, Albreda de Lisours.&nbsp; She married
Richard Fitzeustache, Constable of Chester; which family
subsequently took the name of de Lacy, and (as has been already
stated) became Earls of Lincoln.&nbsp; The estates continued in
this line till 1310; when Henry de Lacy, having no male issue,
left his property to his daughter Alice, who married Thomas, Earl
of Lancaster.&nbsp; He joined a conspiracy against Edward II.,
and being defeated in the battle of Boroughbridge, in the West
Riding of Yorkshire (March 16, 1322), was beheaded on a hill near
his Castle of Pontefract <a name="citation106"></a><a
href="#footnote106" class="citation">[106]</a>; being, it is
said, led out to the spot, by way of disgrace, &ldquo;on a lean
horse,&rdquo; by an official, named Gasgoyne; which name also,
somewhat curiously (as will be seen hereafter), is connected with
Kirkby.&nbsp; A change in ownership now appears; in the family of
Bec, or Beke.&nbsp; In the 13th century one of them Walter Bec
was Constable of Lincoln Castle, under Henry de Lacy, Earl of
Lincoln, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, 1275 (&ldquo;Hundred
Rolls,&rdquo; vol. i. p. 312).&nbsp; But 80 years before this, a
Final Concord, of 27 Nov. 1197, gives the following agreement,
&ldquo;on the 2nd day after the feast of St. Katharine&rdquo;
between Walter, son of Walter Bec, plaintiff, and Richard, Abbot
of Kirkstead, as to a wood called Langhace, and other land
&ldquo;in the field of Kirkebi which is upon Bayne,&rdquo; within
the Court of the said Abbot, whereby Walter &ldquo;quitclaims all
his rights to the Abbot and Convent&rdquo; for which they give
him 4 marks (&pound;21 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d</i>).</p>
<p>By another Concord, on the octave of St. Michael (Oct. 6,
1226), between William Bec, plaintiff, and Henry, Abbot of
Kirkstead, tenant of certain lands, in Kirkby, the Abbot
acknowledges the lands to be &ldquo;of the right of the said
William, which his father also had, to have and to <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>hold (them)
to him and his heirs for ever, of the Abbot, and his successors,
rendering to them 6<i>d.</i> by the year, for all service&rdquo;;
and for this William quitclaims all his rights to the Abbot, and
his successors.</p>
<p>Another Concord (p. 220), shows that in 1227, Walter Bec had
lands in Kirkeby, Tattershale, and Thorpe, which he granted to
Robert de Tateshale; for which the latter was to &ldquo;render
&pound;20 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> yearly, at Kirkby upon Bayne,
and to do the service of one knight&rdquo; (&ldquo;Architect S.
Journal&rdquo; xxiv. p. 34).</p>
<p>By another deed, in the same year, 1227, &ldquo;three weeks
from Easter day&rdquo; (May 1st), between Walter Bec, plaintiff,
and Robert de Tateshale, touching right of warren on the lands of
the said Walter, in Kirkby, Tateshale, and Thorpe, concerning
which Walter complained, that Robert unjustly, and without
warrant, caused warren in the said lands, which rightly are of
the fee of the Bishop of Durham, an agreement is made that Robert
shall give an exchange of lands: whereupon Walter grants to
Robert &ldquo;all his lands in Kirkeby, Tateshale, and Thorpe, in
demesnes, homages, rents, an services of free men, within the
said manor, rendering &pound;21 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, by the
year, at Kirkeby on Bayne, and the service of one knight&rsquo;s
fee&rdquo;; and for this Robert gives him 10 marks (&pound;6
13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>)&nbsp; The head quarters of the Becs were
at Lusby; Henry Bec, of Lusby, being father of the Walter Bec,
already named as Constable of Lincoln Castle.&nbsp; They were
strong in church influence; Thomas Bec, son of the said Walter
Bec, being Bishop of Lincoln, 1342&ndash;1346; while another
Thomas Bec, a cousin, had been Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s,
1280&ndash;1293; and another cousin, Anthony Bec, was Bishop of
Durham, and so connected with Kirkby, as Lord Superior,
1283&ndash;1310.</p>
<p>In a Harleyan charter (45 H. 12) in the British Museum we find
the following, &ldquo;To all sons of Holy Church, Walter Bec, son
of Henry Bec, greeting.&nbsp; Know that I have granted and
quitclaimed to the monks of Kirkstead, the manure of their 300
sheep of their fold of Kirkby.&nbsp; Also I quitclaimed to the
same the toll of my corn, which now they are accustomed to grind,
according to the tenor of their charter &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Witnesses, Richard, Dean of Horncastr, Henry de Langton, Nicholas
Bec, Henry Bec, and others.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>Another name now appears among owners of Kirkby.&nbsp;
The Willoughbys and the Becs inter-married, and by a Feet of
Fines (Lincoln file 68, 32; 30 Ed. I.)&nbsp; Robert de Wilgeby
grants to John Bec, for life only, certain lands in
&ldquo;Kirkeby next Bayne,&rdquo; and 37 other parishes, with
mills, advowson of benefices, 9 fees of knights, &amp;c.; after
his decease the said properties to revert to the said Robert and
his heirs, quit of the heirs of the said John.</p>
<p>By an inquisition <i>ad quod damnum</i> (17 Ed. II., 1323), it
was shewn that this manor was charged with a payment of &pound;21
13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to John son and heir of this Robert de
Wilgeby (Willoughby).</p>
<p>Some of the Lords of Kirkby and Tumby seem to have treated the
Abbots of Kirkstead with considerable liberality; for which,
doubtless, they would receive an equivalent in prayers, if not
&ldquo;indulgences,&rdquo; granted in their favour.&nbsp; In a
cartulary of the Abbey (Vespasian, E., xviii.), now in the
British Museum, is a charter running as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I,
Robert, son of Simon de Tumby, have granted to the Church of St.
Mary of Kirkstead half the fishery of Troholm, and 5 acres of
land in the field of Tumby, and common pasture through all the
fields and territory within the bounds of Tumby.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was early in the 12th century.&nbsp; The witnesses to this
deed, it is to be noticed, are his nephew Richard, and Gilbert,
&ldquo;clerk,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, parson, &ldquo;of
Driebe&rdquo;; hence we should infer that the &ldquo;de
Tumby&rdquo; and &ldquo;de Driby&rdquo; families were one and the
same; and this is proved to have been the case by a Final Concord
of 12 John (<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1211), which
mentions the above grant of &ldquo;5 acres in Tumby&rdquo; to
Simon de Driby and his heirs. <a name="citation108"></a><a
href="#footnote108" class="citation">[108]</a>&nbsp; The grant to
the Abbots of Kirkstead was confirmed, some years later, by
Robert, son of Hugh de Tateshale, who &ldquo;put his hand to the
altar&rdquo; in testimony of the same (charter of same cartulary,
quoted &ldquo;Architect. Journ.,&rdquo; xxiii., p. 107).</p>
<p>By a Chancery Inquisition p.m., 8 Ed. III. (1335), and by a
similar document, 41 Ed. III., it is shown that John de Kirketon
(Kirton) held for life the manor of Tumby, with that of
Tateshale.&nbsp; The Kirktons of Kirton, near <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Boston,
were probably kinsmen of the Dribys, as this transfer was made by
John de Driby, and the Driby armorial bearings were formerly in
the windows of Kirton Church, along with those of the Earls of
Lincoln (connected, as we have seen, with Kirkby) and others
(&ldquo;Lincolnshire Churches,&rdquo; by Stephen Lewin).&nbsp;
This local connection may, in aftertimes, have led to the
marriage alliance of the D&rsquo;Eyncourts, who held the manor of
Kirton, with the next family whom we shall mention, the
Cromwells. <a name="citation109a"></a><a href="#footnote109a"
class="citation">[109a]</a>&nbsp; The above Robert, son of Simon
de Driby (or de Tumby), had to wife Joan, co-heiress of the
Barons of Tattershall; and somehow that connection seems to have
brought the Cromwells into possession of the manor of
Kirkby.&nbsp; In an Inquisition p.m., 22 Rich. II. (1399), Ralph
de Cromwell is described as owning the manor of Kirkby, with that
of Tattershall, through his wife Matilda, or Maud de Bernak,
sister and sole heir of William de Bernak, Lord of
Tattershall.&nbsp; He had lands in 14 parishes in this county, 1
in Derbyshire, and 6 in Notts. <a name="citation109b"></a><a
href="#footnote109b" class="citation">[109b]</a>&nbsp; His
grandson, Ralph, married Margaret, sister and co-heir of the 5th
and last Baron D&rsquo;Eyncourt.&nbsp; His granddaughter, Maud,
married Sir Richard Stanhope, of Rampton, knight.&nbsp; Their
daughter, Maud, married Sir Gervase Clifton, of Clifton, knight,
&ldquo;The gentle Sir Gervase,&rdquo; who was killed at the
battle of Tewkesbury, May 4, 1471; and afterwards married Sir
Thomas Neville, and then the 6th Baron Willoughby d&rsquo;
Eresby.&nbsp; Thus we have a number of <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>important
alliances of this family of Kirkby proprietors (&ldquo;Architect.
S. Journal,&rdquo; 1858, p. 228).</p>
<p>At the time when Gervase Holles, in 1630, made his
peregrinations round this county, he says that there were in the
windows of the rectory house, of Kirkby, the armorial bearings,
in coloured glass, of some 20 leading county families,
including&mdash;Becs, Willoughbys, Percys, Tyrwhitts, Tailbois,
Dymokes, &amp;c.&nbsp; These had probably been originally in the
windows of the church, and, on the decay of the edifice, had been
transferred to the house.&nbsp; Representations of these are
given in the Harleyan MS. (6829), now in the British Museum,
together with a description of monuments formerly in the church,
but now lost.&nbsp; These arms enable us to form an idea of the
great families who were connected with this parish.&nbsp; The
association with the place of the Tailbois is not quite clear;
but Gilbert Tailbois was summoned to Parliament, as Baron
Tailbois, in the reign of Henry VIII., when he showed that he was
descended from Sir Edward Dymoke, who married Anne
Tailbois.&nbsp; This Gilbert was also descended from Henry
Tailbois, who married Eleanor Burdon, daughter of Gilbert Burdon,
by Elizabeth de Umfraville, sister and heiress of the Earl of
Angus (&ldquo;Dugdale&rsquo;s Baronage,&rdquo; vol. i.); who
again was related to the de Kymes, kinsmen of the Dymokes; the
Kymes also being connected with the old and distinguished county
family of the Ayscoughs.</p>
<p>The connection of the Dymokes with Kirkby is seen in the
following bequest of &ldquo;Arthur Dymmocke of Toft Grange, in
the p&rsquo;she of Kyrkebye,&rdquo; of date May 27, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, 1558.&nbsp; &ldquo;I geve and
bequeathe to the Church of the said Kyrkebye one satteyn gown, to
make a coope or a vestment.&nbsp; I will that there shall be
distributed among the poore people at my buriall
xiii<sup>li</sup>. xii<sup>s</sup>. viii.&nbsp; I give to the
poore people of the towneshipp of Kirkebye vi<sup>li</sup>., to
the poore of Tunbye xl<sup>s</sup>.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are also
bequests to &ldquo;Marum, Willesby, Screuelby, Roughton,
Connyngesbye, Tattershall, Haltam,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; He adds,
&ldquo;I will that myne executour shall geve to the marriages of
poore maydens, at their discretions, xxvj<sup>li</sup>.&nbsp; I
geve to the repayring of fowle and noysome hie wayes
xxvj<sup>li</sup>.&nbsp; I geve to my brother Sir Edwarde
Dymmocke, Knight, tenne pound, and my best gelding, with the best
jewell he will chuse among all my jewells.&nbsp; I geve to my
sister his wif one <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>gold ring w<sup>t</sup> a turkey (turquoise).&nbsp; I
geve to Sir <a name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a> Thomas Olive, p&rsquo;sonne of
Kirkebye one gold ring enamelled.&rdquo;&nbsp; These, and many
more bequests to poor people in the county of Middlesex, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., show that Arthur Dymoke of Toft Grange, was a man of
substance, as well as of generous mind.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N.
&amp; Q.&rdquo; July 1897, vol. v., No. 39).</p>
<p>We now get another family resident in this parish, of some
importance.&nbsp; We have mentioned Fulsby Hall, of which nothing
certain now remains.&nbsp; This demesne would seem to have
belonged to the Nelthorpes of Scawby, N. Lincolnshire, but it was
occupied by a family named Cressy.&nbsp; The Cressy pedigree is
given in a MS. book of &ldquo;Lincolnshire Gentry,&rdquo; written
by Thomas Beckwith, F.S.A., 1768, and preserved in the Library of
Revesby Abbey (&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; vol. ii., p.
166).&nbsp; As far back as <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>,
1216, we find a William de Cressy named, along with Ralph de Haya
(an old Norman family), as being &ldquo;sureties for the faithful
service&rdquo; of Simon de Driby, already named.&nbsp;
(Hardy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rolls de oblatis et finibus,&rdquo; p.
575.)&nbsp; Whether he was of the same family we cannot say, but
it is some hundreds of years before the name occurs again.</p>
<p>Also a charter of Hamelin, Count de Warren, and his Countess
Isabella, about <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, 1074,
mentions a Roger de Cressy, with whom they unite in granting a
wood, and other properties, &ldquo;to God and the Church of St.
Victor, and the Monks thereof,&rdquo; in Normandy.&nbsp; The same
charter also names 3 houses given by Ranulph de Cressy,
&ldquo;for the soul of his brother Hugh,&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Arch&aelig;ological Journal,&rdquo; No. 9, 1846.)&nbsp;
Thomas Cressy, of Fulsby, is named among the Gentry of
Lincolnshire in the &ldquo;Herald&rsquo;s Visitation&rdquo; of
1634, preserved in the Library of the Herald&rsquo;s
College.&nbsp; Canon Maddison in a note to his
&ldquo;Lincolnshire Wills&rdquo; (p. 141) says that Nicholas
Cressy married Frances, daughter of Sir Henry Ayscough, Knight of
Blyborough, and left Blyborough for Kirkby-on-Bain, <i>i.e.</i>,
for Toft Grange.&nbsp; The daughter, Faith, of this Nicholas
Cressy, married George Tyrwhitt, a cadet of the Kettleby family
of Tyrwhitts; and we have already seen that the Tyrwhitt arms
were among those formerly in the Rectory windows.&nbsp; Her
sister Jane married Sir Edward Dymoke, <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Knight, of
Scrivelsby.&nbsp; Her eldest brother was named Brandon, from the
connection of the Ayscoughs, with Charles Brandon, Duke of
Suffolk.&nbsp; This Faith had a daughter named
&ldquo;Douglas&rdquo;; the Tyrwhitts being related to the
Sheffields, and John, 2nd Lord Sheffield married Douglas,
daughter of William, 1st Lord Howard of Effingham.&nbsp; His son,
again, Edmund, created Earl of Mulgrave, married about 1590,
Ursula, daughter of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt of Kettleby.&nbsp; Faith
Tyrwhitt, by will, dated 18 Feb<sup>y</sup>, 1669, leaves
bequests to Lady Jane Dymoke, to her brother Major Thomas Cressy,
to Edward and Charles Dymoke, to Elizabeth Dymoke, her
goddaughter; and &ldquo;to my good child Douglas everything
else.&rdquo;&nbsp; This &ldquo;Douglas&rdquo; was baptized at
Horncastle, 8 January, 1628&ndash;9.</p>
<p>There is some difficulty in connecting the Percy family with
Kirkby, beyond the fact that their arms were among those in the
rectory windows.&nbsp; But a Chancery Inquisition post mortem of
1381&ndash;2 (5 Richard II., No. 47), shows that Mary de Percy,
wife of John de Roos, was next heir to Margaret, wife of John de
Orby, who was jointly enfeoffed of certain lands in Tattershall,
&amp;c.; and that on her decease the Earl of Northumberland (a
Percy) held and occupied the same, he having married their
daughter Joan, as second wife.&nbsp; The above John de Orby is
stated to have been kinsman and heir of Robert de Tateshale,
knight.&nbsp; These lands were also held of the Duke of
Lancaster, a Gaunt.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; vol.
vi., No. 47, p. 73).&nbsp; We further find that after the death
of Gilbert de Gaunt, his widow the Countess Roheis, in her own
right married one &ldquo;Robertus, Dapifer&rdquo; who was steward
to the house of Percy (&ldquo;Topographist and Genealogist&rdquo;
i., 303).&nbsp; If this was, as seems likely, a Robert de
Tateshale, he would be a landowner in Tumby, and, as steward,
also a vassal of the Percys, Earls of Northumberland.&nbsp; As
further connecting the Percy family with this neighbourhood, we
may mention, that among the Revesby charters, is one of date
about 1142, the witnesses to which are Henry de Perci, Gilbert de
Bec, and others.&nbsp; The same Henry de Perci is also witness to
another of these charters, of date 1155.</p>
<p>The arms of the Willoughbys have been already mentioned as
among those formerly in the Rectory.&nbsp; This may be accounted
for by the fact that Matilda, or <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Maud, Lady Willoughby, widow of Lord
Cromwell, died in 1497, seized of a greater part of the
possessions of her late husband, and, among others, &ldquo;in fee
tail of the manor of Kyrkeby upon Bayne&rdquo; (&ldquo;Chancery
Inquisition&rdquo; p.m., 13, Henry vii., No. 34.&nbsp; Quoted
&ldquo;Architect S. Journal&rdquo; xxiii. p. 132.)</p>
<p>We have now shown links connecting this parish, more or less
closely, with most of the families whose armorial bearings
formerly existed here.&nbsp; There is only one more name not yet
accounted for: that of Gasgoyne.&nbsp; We are unable positively
to establish any link in this case.&nbsp; Camden tells us
(&ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; pp. 714&ndash;731), that the Gasgoynes
were an &ldquo;ancient and virtuous family of Yorkshire, seated
at Gawthorpe, probably (he says) from Gasgoyne in France,&rdquo;
to which family belonged the famous Judge, Sir William Gasgoyne,
who showed his courage by committing to prison the young Prince,
who was to be the future King Henry V.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned that the property of the de Lacys
(including, probably, Kirkby) passed to Thomas, Earl of
Lancaster, who was afterwards beheaded for rebellion, being led
out for execution by an officer named Gasgoyne.&nbsp; It would
appear, therefore, that a Gasgoyne held some official post at
Pontefract Castle, and that Lordship (as we have seen), was
connected with Kirkby, as belonging to the same noble owners, de
Lacys, and others; and hence the Gasgoyne arms appear along with
those of the de Lacys, and others.&nbsp; The name of Gasgoyne is
found in Stow&rsquo;s copy of the roll of Battle Abbey, as among
the distinguished soldiers who came over with the Conqueror,
coupled with Gaunt, Gaunville, and many another good name.</p>
<p>At the dissolution of religious houses by Henry VIII., we find
among institutions to benefices, that Robert Brantingham, was
presented to Kirkby, in 1565, by Robert Brantingham, of
Horncastle, by reason of the advowson, for that turn, being
granted to him by &ldquo;the late Prior and Convent of the
Cathedral Church of Durham.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so ended the
connection of Kirkby with the See of the proud Bishops of
Durham.&nbsp; On the extinction of the Cromwell line these lands,
in Tattershall, Tattershall Thorpe, Kirkby, &amp;c., would revert
to the King.&nbsp; Henry VIII. granted Tattershall, and doubtless
the other possessions, to his mother Margaret, Countess <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>of
Richmond; and in the following year entailed them on the
Duke.&nbsp; On the latter dying without issue, Henry granted a
vast number of estates in this, and other localities, to Charles
Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.&nbsp; On the death of two infant sons
of the Duke, shortly after their father&rsquo;s decease, Edward
VI. granted them to Edward, Lord Clinton, whose arms were also
among those formerly in the rectory windows.&nbsp; His descendant
Edward Earl of Lincoln, died without issue in 1692, when the
properties passed to his cousin Bridget, who married Hugh
Fortescue, Esq.; whose son was created Baron Fortescue, and Earl
of Lincoln in 1740; and a large portion of Kirkby is still the
property of Lord Fortescue, who is Lord of the Manor, other
owners being the Clinton, Wilson, Ashton, Lely families, Lockwood
trustees, &amp;c.</p>
<p>By a similar process the lands formerly held by the Monks of
Revesby, were granted, on the dissolution, by Henry VIII. to his
&ldquo;well beloved and dear kinsman,&rdquo; the aforesaid Duke
of Suffolk, Charles Brandon.&nbsp; Among these are named lands in
Tumby, Fulsby, Kirkby-on-Bain, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; From the
Brandons they passed to the great Lord Treasurer Burleigh, and
then to the Howards; then to the family of Sir Joseph Banks; and
he, dying without issue, left his estates divided among the
families of Stanhope, Sir H. Hawley, Bart., and Sir Edward
Knatchbull, Bart.&nbsp; The present Sir Henry M. Hawley, of
Leybourne, Maidstone, Kent, is lord of the manor of Tumby,
including Fulsby, and resides at Tumby Lawn.&nbsp; Some of the
land belongs to the representatives of the late Right Honourable
E. Stanhope, H. Rogers, Esq., and smaller proprietors.&nbsp; The
Fulsby Hall Farm, with the watermill, was given in 1669 to the
Grammar School at Brigg, by Sir John Nelthorpe, the then
proprietor; but most of this has been purchased in late years by
Sir Henry James Hawley; so that there now only remain some 70
acres, and the Fulsby watermill, connected with that school.</p>
<p>Just outside the parish to the south-east is a large wood, now
called &ldquo;Shire Wood&rdquo;; but in a Revesby charter (No.
29), date Henry II., the name is given as
&ldquo;Skire-wode&rdquo;; which is Danish, connected with our
words &ldquo;shear&rdquo; to cut, and &ldquo;shire&rdquo; a
division, and means the &ldquo;boundary,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;dividing&rdquo; wood.&nbsp; The same syllable occurs in
the &ldquo;Skir-beck&rdquo; quarter of Boston.&nbsp; In a smaller
<a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>wood, in
the west of the parish, called &ldquo;Kirkby Riddings&rdquo; we
have another relic of the Danes, as Mr. Streatfeild, in his work
&ldquo;Lincolnshire and the Danes,&rdquo; tells us, that in their
language &ldquo;ridja&rdquo; means to &ldquo;clear away a
wood.&rdquo;&nbsp; We still speak of &ldquo;ridding
ourselves&rdquo; of anything, when we clear it away.&nbsp; The
Kirkby Riddings, doubtless tell of the &ldquo;clearings&rdquo; in
those larger woods which we have already mentioned as formerly
existing here, wherein the Lords of the demesne found their sport
in the chase of the deer, the wild boar, and other animals. <a
name="citation115a"></a><a href="#footnote115a"
class="citation">[115a]</a>&nbsp; Those &ldquo;hardy
Norsemen&rdquo; were a tough race, and have thus left their
traces behind them.</p>
<p>We have mentioned an Ayscough in connection with Kirkby; a
daughter of Sir Henry Ayscough having married Nicholas Cressy of
Fulsby Hall.&nbsp; This was a very old family, originally located
in Yorkshire; the name having probably been Akes-heugh, or
Ake-shaw, <i>i.e.</i>, Oak-wood; it afterwards came to be spelt
in a variety of ways, as Ayscough, Ayscoghe, Aiscough, Askew,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>They claimed descent from a Saxon thane, Thurstan &ldquo;de
Bosco,&rdquo; and &ldquo;boscus&rdquo; is Latin for
&ldquo;wood,&rdquo; or &ldquo;coppice.&rdquo;&nbsp; This confirms
the above meaning.&nbsp; The heraldic device of the family was
&ldquo;three asses coughing&rdquo; (Guillim&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Heraldry,&rdquo; 1794), and the name, in some of their
branches, is still pronounced like Ass-<i>coff</i> and not
Ass-coe.&nbsp; They have been distinguished in church, court, and
camp, acquiring large property in Lincolnshire, and allying
themselves with some of our oldest families, the Tailbois,
Brandons, Hilyards, St. Pauls, Kymes, Clintons, Heneages,
Foljambes, Saviles, Boucheretts, &amp;c.&nbsp; They gave to this
county, what the county may well be proud of, Anne Askew, who
died at the stake, a Martyr for the Protestant faith, at
Smithfield, 16 July, 1546. <a name="citation115b"></a><a
href="#footnote115b" class="citation">[115b]</a>&nbsp; A Walter
Ascoughe, and Henry his son, are named among those who succeeded
to parts of the former Revesby Abbey <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>estates, when the Duke of
Suffolk&rsquo;s family became extinct.&nbsp; (Dugdale&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Baronage&rdquo; ii., 300).&nbsp; And this family is still
established in various parts of the kingdom, the name surviving
in all ranks of life.&nbsp; Few families are without their
humbler connections.&nbsp; For instance, in the case of the
parish with which we are now concerned, we find in its former
records a &ldquo;Robert de Tumbi&rdquo; who was a Bec, or a
Bernak, or a Cromwell, lord of many a manor, and also a
&ldquo;William de Tumbi&rdquo; who was a bondman of John Bec,
lord of the manor, whose &ldquo;body and chattels,&rdquo; the
said John reserves to himself, while giving the land on which the
said William labours, to the Abbey of Kirkstead.&nbsp; (Charter
of John Bec. Harley, MS. 45, H. 13).</p>
<p>So in modern times, the late lord of the manor of Tumby, Sir
Henry James Hawley, Bart., married, as his first wife, Miss
Elizabeth Askew, in the south of England, while, in a humbler
sphere in life, we find a small farmer, in the person of Mr.
Thomas Askew, residing in Kirkby-on-Bain; an illustration in a
new sense of Shakespeare&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;a touch of nature
makes the world akin&rdquo; (&ldquo;Troilus and Cressida&rdquo;
act. iii., sc. iii.)</p>
<p>As these notes have now reached a considerable length, we will
briefly notice the Church of St. Mary, at Kirkby; and indeed, it
barely deserves more than a brief notice, as it has no claims to
architectural beauty.</p>
<p>We may well suppose, that, as at that other Kirkby, now known
as Pontefract, a fine church was once a feature of the locality,
so it was once the same here; but this is no longer the
case.&nbsp; If those armorial bearings which Gervase Holles saw
in the rectory 250 years ago, were originally in the church, as
would seem probable, they would doubtless embellish a fabric of
some size and beauty.&nbsp; We can hardly imagine, that the
benefice, under the patronage of rich prelates like the Bishop of
Durham, in a parish also connected with important monasteries
like those of Kirkstead and Revesby, having also powerful
landowners such as the Becs, Willoughbys, Cromwells, and other
&ldquo;Lords of Tattershall&rdquo; (where so fine a collegiate
church was provided by them), would have been left with an
unworthy church here.&nbsp; But whatever may have been its former
merits, of these there are no longer any traces.&nbsp; On the
south side lies the square base of a churchyard cross, shorn of
its shaft, probably by the reckless Puritans, who may also have
demolished, as they often did, the fine <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>stained-glass windows, of which the armorial bearings,
once in the rectory, may likely enough have been remnants.&nbsp;
Gervase Holles mentions two monuments which were in the church in
his time.&nbsp; Of these one was in the chancel, having a quaint
Latin inscription to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Richard Lambard lies by this stone entombed;<br />
Of this Church formerly Rector was he.<br />
Who caused this Chancel to be newly built.<br />
He presented a Missal, and other valuables.<br />
On the 14<sup>th</sup> day of January he sought the stars,<br />
In the 1450<sup>th</sup> year of our Lord.<br />
To whom God grant eternal rest!&nbsp; Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a flat slab, beside the above, was the following, also in
Latin:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>William Bulliar lies here entombed;<br />
Of this church formerly Rector was he;<br />
He caused a new Crucifix to be erected.<br />
He presented a gradual <a name="citation117a"></a><a
href="#footnote117a" class="citation">[117a]</a> and cross, and
other valuables.<br />
He died the 11<sup>th</sup> day of December, 1510.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was also apparently a window to his memory.</p>
<p>Of a later Church, in a state of ruin, there was given an
engraving in the &ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine&rdquo; of
August 11, 1801, with brief account of the church; a copy of
which is in the possession of the present rector, the Rev. R.
Gathorne, M.A.; framed, in his study. <a
name="citation117b"></a><a href="#footnote117b"
class="citation">[117b]</a>&nbsp; In that later edifice, the
pulpit is said to have been a massive one, of stone.&nbsp; But
this, like the monuments given above, has disappeared.&nbsp; Of
the present church, built in 1802, the best we can say is that it
is in the style called &ldquo;Debased <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>Gothic.&rdquo;&nbsp; The late
rector, the Rev. C. F. R. Baylay, rural dean, &amp;c., put stone
mullions, in place of wood, in the windows, in 1879; when the
late bishop, Dr. Christopher Wordsworth, performed the ceremony
of re-opening the church on November 6th, as is recorded on a
brass tablet on the north wall of the nave.&nbsp; The church was,
at the same time, re-seated with open sittings of
pitch-pine.&nbsp; The western gallery was also then
removed.&nbsp; Over the west door is a good painting of the royal
arms, of date 1712, with initials &ldquo;A.R.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Anne
Regina).&nbsp; There is a slab in the pavement of the nave at its
east end, in memory of Rev. T. Roe, formerly rector.&nbsp; The
font is plain octagonal.&nbsp; The ceiling is flat, of polished
pitch-pine.&nbsp; There are three plain windows in the south wall
of the nave, and two in the north wall.&nbsp; The chancel is
apsidal, with a three-light window in the centre, and a small
single-light window on each side.&nbsp; The chancel arch is
unusually low, and broad, out of proportion.&nbsp; The only
handsome thing in the church is the communion table, which is of
old oak, probably of the Caroline period, massive, and richly
carved, having a curious cupboard below the upper slab.&nbsp; It
is, however, more fit to be a chiffonier or dining room
sideboard, than for its present use.&nbsp; The church has
accommodation for 212, which is amply sufficient, as the once
&ldquo;Town&rdquo; of Kirkby has been decreasing in population
for many years.&nbsp; The one bell hangs in an external small
turret.&nbsp; The registers date from 1562.</p>
<p>The present rectory is a commodious residence, built in 1827,
at a cost of &pound;1,800.&nbsp; It stands in almost park-like
grounds, with fine timber.&nbsp; The village school was rebuilt
in 1870, with residence for the teacher, and was endowed by
Richard Brocklesby with 33 acres of land in the parish of
Bicker.&nbsp; The poor have an interest in the almshouses of Sir
Joseph Banks at Reyesby; also a yearly dole of 5<i>s.</i>, left
by Martha Chamberlain.</p>
<p>The poet Dyer, who was appointed rector of Coningsby, by Sir
John Heathcote in 1752, became rector of Kirkby in 1755, but
presently exchanged it for Belchford.&nbsp; He was the author of
&ldquo;Grongar Hill,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fleece,&rdquo; and other
poems of some merit, and was honoured in a complimentary sonnet
by Wordsworth, the Laureate.</p>
<p>Another rector, the Rev. Willoughby West, extended his charity
beyond his own parish, since by will dated 30 January, 1690, he
founded two almshouses, for <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>deserving poor persons, in the
parish of Langton-by-Horncastle, (he being one of the patrons of
the benefice), endowed with the rent of land purchased by him
&ldquo;from Geo. Langto of Langto, Esq.&rdquo;&nbsp; His burial
is registered at Kirkby, 29 May, 1691, and that of his wife, Mary
Ester, &ldquo;April ye 8th, 1690.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At &ldquo;Leeds Gate,&rdquo; to the south of this parish, in
Coningsby, are two fields, named &ldquo;Gibbet close,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Gibbet nook close,&rdquo; where probably some offenders
formerly expiated their misdeeds, under the stern hand of the
lord of the manor. <a name="citation119"></a><a
href="#footnote119" class="citation">[119]</a>&nbsp; The name
&ldquo;Leeds gate,&rdquo; given in old maps as
&ldquo;Lidyate,&rdquo; is probably a corruption of &ldquo;Our
Lady&rsquo;s gate&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> road); there having been
formerly a &ldquo;Guild of the Virgin Mary,&rdquo; connected with
Coningsby church.&nbsp; There are also two fields called
&ldquo;Over Coney Green,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Low Coney
Green,&rdquo; which may have reference to the rabbit warren of
Tumby Chase, or to &ldquo;the King&rsquo;s Garth,&rdquo; or
inclosure, &ldquo;Conig,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> King, also forming
part of the name Coningsby.&nbsp; These field-names are found in
several other parishes.&nbsp; There are fields called
&ldquo;Otter Close,&rdquo; &ldquo;Best Moor,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Worst Moor,&rdquo; the not uncommon &ldquo;Pingle&rdquo;
(or small croft), &ldquo;North Ings,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tumby
Ings,&rdquo; these meaning well-watered meadows.&nbsp; Another
name, not easy to explain, though not uncommon, is
&ldquo;Pry-close.&rdquo;&nbsp; It occurs also in Woodhall and
elsewhere.&nbsp; One interpretation which has been suggested is
that it may have marked the place where watch was kept for game,
or game-marauders, or like &ldquo;Toot-hill,&rdquo; also found in
the vicinity, it may have been a look-out for cattle, strayed in
the time of Fen floods.&nbsp; But another suggestion is that it
is a form of the old Norman &ldquo;Pre,&rdquo; a meadow, praie
being a kind of coarse grass.&nbsp; Near Northampton, there are
&ldquo;the verdant meads of de la Pre,&rdquo; and in Normandy
there was a monastery of &ldquo;De la Pre de Rouen,&rdquo;
attached to the abbey of Bec, and the Norman Becs (as we have
seen) were connected with Kirkby and Tumby.&nbsp; There is a
&ldquo;Pry-farm,&rdquo; in Wiltshire.&nbsp; What is now only
Fulsby mill, in this parish, was formerly and within living
memory also, a public-house, rejoicing in the name of &ldquo;The
Jolly Sailor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, after the murder of Stennet
Jeffery, in &ldquo;the Wilderness&rdquo; of Whitehall <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>Wood, on
June 22, 1822, the murderers, who belonged to Coningsby Moor,
stopped for refreshment.&nbsp; They were said to be
&ldquo;bankers,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> navvies, whose chief
employment was digging drains, repairing their banks, &amp;c.;
while employed on the Horncastle canal near at hand, they had
doubtless frequented the house before.&nbsp; They were usually
rough and even violent characters, and it is said that Mrs.
Copping, the landlady of the Inn, was aware of their guilt, but
too much afraid of them to mention it.&nbsp; After their visit,
some blood-stained clothing was found concealed in a hedge hard
by.&nbsp; Two of these men were convicted of the murder and
transported for life.&nbsp; (See &ldquo;Records of Woodhall
Spa,&rdquo; by J. Conway Walter, pp. 16, 17.)</p>
<p>Geologically, Kirkby has some interest; parts of the parish
are on the blue clay, with ammonites and other fossils, while
there is also a stratum of fine gravel, termed the &ldquo;Bain
terraces,&rdquo; in which teeth of the &ldquo;elephas
primi-genius&rdquo; have been found.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Government
Geolog. Survey,&rdquo; Lincoln, 1888, pp. 161, &amp;c.)</p>
<p>To the ornithologist and entomologist its interest would seem
to be increasing.&nbsp; The abandonment of the Horncastle canal,
which runs through this parish, is making it a sort of sanctuary
where the coot, the moorhen, the dab-chick, and the mallard
resort; the green sand-piper may be seen, skimming the water, or
the king-fisher darting into the shallows, and the heron, which
nests in the adjacent woods, stands like a silent sentinel on one
leg, by its pools, on the watch for its finny prey.&nbsp; On the
reedy banks of the fast silting-up canal, it would hardly be
surprising if that rarity among butterflies, the swallow-tail,
which over-drainage has driven from its former haunts, should
once more re-appear.&nbsp; But we have said enough about Kirkby,
and more than exceeded the measure of space allowed us.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Kirkby</span>, <span
class="smcap">East</span>.</h3>
<p>East Kirkby is situated just below the steep slope of the
Wolds, near their southern extremity, between 7 and 8 miles south
south-east of Horncastle, 6 miles south-west from Spilsby, and 9
miles north-east from Tattershall.&nbsp; From Horncastle it is
approached <i>vi&acirc;</i> Scrivelsby and Moorby.&nbsp; It is
contiguous, on the east, to Revesby.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>This
in one of the 220 odd parishes in the county which possessed a
church before the Norman Conquest.&nbsp; At that period it seems
to have been united with Revesby, since in Domesday Book
(1080&ndash;86) &ldquo;Cherchebi&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Resuesbi&rdquo; are given together, and it is stated that
&ldquo;the whole manor and all that belongs thereto is six miles
long, and six miles broad.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are 12 carucates
(or 1440 acres) rateable to gelt (<i>i.e.</i>, 2<i>s.</i> to the
carucate); and the same extent of arable land (or 2,880 acres in
all); with (in Saxon times), 54 socmen, and 14 villeins.&nbsp;
The great Norman Noble, Ivo Taillebois, Chief of the Angevine
troops of the Conqueror, was lord of this manor, through his
marriage with the wealthy Saxon, Lady Lucia, heiress of the
Thorolds.&nbsp; On his death early in life&mdash;a death not
regretted by her, for the marriage had been forced upon her by
the Conqueror&mdash;she re-married, with hardly a decent delay,
Roger de Romara, about 1093; and by him had a son, William de
Romara, who was created Earl of Lincoln.&nbsp; This William
founded Revesby Abbey in 1142, and, by an interchange of lands,
while retaining Revesby, Moorby, Wilksby, &amp;c., as a compact
property, he separated East Kirkby as a distinct domain.&nbsp;
Among those with whom exchanges were effected was one Ivo, a
priest, who held a church at Thoresby, probably standing on the
site of the present Revesby church.&nbsp; In lieu of this, the
Earl gave to Ivo the church of East Kirkby with its
appurtenances, and a toft near the churchyard.&nbsp; In the 13th
century, the family of de la Launde (represented, down to recent
times, by the Kings, of Ashby de la Laund, near Sleaford) were
manorial lords <a name="citation121"></a><a href="#footnote121"
class="citation">[121]</a> of East Kirkby, while the Earls of
Exeter (as shewn in Notes on Revesby, &amp;c.) had the manor of
Thoresby and Revesby, &amp;c.&nbsp; East Kirkby, as well as
Revesby, was in the soke of Old Bolingbroke, and, as parts of the
Duchy of Lancaster, the Sovereign would be the superior lord of
the various manors in that soke, or &ldquo;Honour,&rdquo; as it
was named, as being connected with royalty.&nbsp; Accordingly, in
1604, we find that Sir V. Skinner, of Bolingbroke, was appointed
by the crown keeper of Kirkby Park, the site of which is still
shown on old maps; and, according to &ldquo;Liber Regis,&rdquo;
<a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>in 1762
the Sovereign presented to the benefice, although, by some
arrangement, William Ellis, Esq., had presented in 1719.&nbsp;
The manor now belongs to R. Maidens, Esq., and Dr. T. Robinson,
but most of the soil belongs to the Stanhope or Coltman families,
the patronage of the benefice being in the hands of the
former.</p>
<p>Among the Revesby charters and deeds, printed by the late Rt.
Hon. E. Stanhope, is one (No. 27) of Alan Smerehorn, of East
Kirkby, dated 1165, by which he gives a watermill and premises to
the Abbots of Revesby, with the right to draw water through his
land, from Bolingbroke to Kirkby; the Abbey thus being supplied
with water. <a name="citation122"></a><a href="#footnote122"
class="citation">[122]</a>&nbsp; He also, by another deed (No.
28), conveys to the Abbey his rights in certain lands in Kirkby,
undertaking all claims and services due to the King, in return
for which the Revesby Monks confirm to him certain rights in
Hagnaby.</p>
<p>By a deed of the same period, Alan, son of Walter of Kirkby,
gives his feudal rights, in certain lands in Kirkby, to the
monks, with lands in Hagnaby and Engcroft in Stickford, free of
all claims from the King.</p>
<p>A charter of Richard I. (&ldquo;Dugdale,&rdquo; v. 456)
confirms to the Monks of Revesby, among other possessions, 620
acres of land in E. Kirkby, and part of Kirkby Wood, along the
road called &ldquo;Swinistigate&rdquo; (No. 40 B).&nbsp;
N.B.&mdash;There is still a Swinecote in Revesby.&nbsp; Various
other deeds assign to the monks lands given by William son of
Ivo, of Kirkby (No. 43); by Alan son of Walter of Kirkby (No.
45); by Lucy widow of Walter Faber, of Kirkby (a
&ldquo;Smith?&rdquo;) a meadow, &ldquo;to decorate and strew the
monk&rsquo;s choir.&rdquo; (No. 56).&nbsp; While Henry Smerehorn
gives to them his &ldquo;servant Robert, son of Colsvan, with all
his chattels&rdquo; (No. 53); and Alan Smerehorn, of Kirkby,
gives a plot &ldquo;ad portam josep.&rdquo; (at the Joseph gate),
among several others, taking on himself all claims to the king or
others (No. 58).&nbsp; The seal of Smerehorn is a round one with
the device, a man blowing a horn.&nbsp; Gaufrid, son of Alan
Buche, of Kirkby, gives land in E. Kirkby specially as
&ldquo;gate alms&rdquo; for the poor (No. 68); the same Gaufrid
also confirming the gift made by his brother Walter, of a meadow
in Goutscroft (No. 70).&nbsp; N.B.&mdash;&ldquo;Gout,&rdquo; or,
writ fully, &ldquo;go-out,&rdquo; means a spring issuing from a
hill side, of which there are many on the Wold slopes
(Streatfeild, <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>&ldquo;Lincolnshire and the Danes,&rdquo; p. 174). <a
name="citation123a"></a><a href="#footnote123a"
class="citation">[123a]</a>&nbsp; Alan de Cuilter, of Kirkby,
among other lands, gives a place (placeam) called
&ldquo;gayres&rdquo; (No. 101); gaire meaning a triangular plot
which requires ploughing a different way to the rest of the
ground. <a name="citation123b"></a><a href="#footnote123b"
class="citation">[123b]</a>&nbsp; A meadow in Kirkby is given by
Nicholas son of Roger, of Miningsby, towards maintaining
&ldquo;the light before the image of St. Nicholas in Kirkby
Church, every St. Nicholas&rsquo; day.&rdquo; (No. 119).</p>
<p>There are other deeds connected with East Kirkby, but these
are typical.</p>
<p>We give here some other records connected with East Kirkby,
which are of more or less interest, taken from
&ldquo;Lincolnshire Wills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Saltfletby, alias Massenge <a
name="citation123c"></a><a href="#footnote123c"
class="citation">[123c]</a> of &ldquo;Kirkby juxta
Bolingbroke,&rdquo; by his will, dated 3 January, 1443, requests
that he may be buried in Kirkby Church; and leaves money to the
church, as well as to the Church of St. Peter in Eastgate,
Lincoln; also to his daughter, his wife, and her daughter,
certain lands in Kirkby, Miningsby, and West Kele; and his house
opposite the Church of St. Peter, Eastgate, &ldquo;called the
Gryffin.&rdquo;&nbsp; The witnesses are Robt. Drydyke, Vicar of
Kirkby (N.B.&mdash;The place-name Drysykes occurs in Salmonby);
John Cokeryll, chaplain of the same; and Hugh Wellys, clerk.</p>
<p>Richard Skepper, of East Kirkby, by will dated 26 May, 1556,
requests to be buried in the church; and leaves to his sons,
Thomas, George, and Edward, and daughters, Bridget and Anne, his
copyholds in Kirkby, Miningsby, Bolingbroke, Waynflete, Irby,
Thorpe, and Friskney.&nbsp; N.B.&mdash;This was a family from
Durham.</p>
<p>John Ballet, parson of Nether Toynton, by his will, of 17
April, 1558, leaves his &ldquo;gown, that the Bishop of Ely gave
him,&rdquo; to Mr. Goodryke, of Kirkby <a
name="citation123d"></a><a href="#footnote123d"
class="citation">[123d]</a> and a gold ring; <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>he also
leaves money to repair the roads between Fulletby and
Horncastle.</p>
<p>Connected with the Goodricks, by marriage, were the
Littleburies, descended as is shown elsewhere <a
name="citation124a"></a><a href="#footnote124a"
class="citation">[124a]</a> from a very ancient knightly family,
originally seated in south Lincolnshire, and hence we find the
following will of Humphrey Littlebury, of East Kirkby, dated 1
Sep., 1568, by which he leaves all his lands in Hagworthingham to
his son John, who is to pay to his brother Edward xx<sup>li</sup>
a year &ldquo;for his <i>exhibition</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation124b"></a><a href="#footnote124b"
class="citation">[124b]</a> during the widow&rsquo;s lifetime;
the annuity to cease when the said Edward becomes a
&ldquo;counsaler,&rdquo; and able to provide for himself.&nbsp;
He bequeaths his lands in Hareby, East Keal, Keal Cotes, and
Raithby, to his daughter Ann, &ldquo;if she will be ordered by
her friends, Sir John Kersey and John Littlebury,&rdquo; and if
she will not, then &ldquo;never a penny.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would
rather appear, from this testamentary provision, that the said
daughter Ann was somewhat of a wilful &ldquo;hussy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sir John Kersey would be one of the family who came in for a
share of the Revesby estates after the extinction of the direct
line of the Dukes of Suffolk.&nbsp; To his daughter Dorothy he
leaves &ldquo;one hundred marks&rdquo; with a like proviso.&nbsp;
To his son John he leaves a &ldquo;ring with the seal,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, the family signet; also &ldquo;one silver salt, vi.
silver spoons, 1 silver goblet, gilt, a flat silver piece, and 1
of my silver pots I bought in London.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reference is
then made to an Inventory of Lyon Goodricke, deceased, which was
bequeathed to testator&rsquo;s wife, Winifred, and Edward
Goodricke, her son.&nbsp; The testator had married (1) Ursula, <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>co-heir of
Sir John Kersey, k<sup>nt</sup>., of Grove, co. Notts, and (2)
Winifred, daughter of Henry Sapcote <a name="citation125a"></a><a
href="#footnote125a" class="citation">[125a]</a> of Lincoln, and
widow of Lyon Goodricke, of East Kirkby.</p>
<p>We have noticed, above, a Richard Skepper, of East Kirkby,
whose will was dated 26 May, 1556.&nbsp; We find later, the will
of George Skeeper, of Boston, evidently the same name, of date 28
Sep., 1606, in which he desires to be buried &ldquo;in
y<sup>e</sup> parish church of East Kirkby.&rdquo;&nbsp; The name
still survives in this neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Another name still occupying a position in the county is that
of Booth, and we find that William Booth, of East Kirkby, by will
dated 31 Oct., 1584, left property to his brother George&rsquo;s
children in Cheshire, to his brother Edward&rsquo;s children, of
Rand, to George Booth of Thorpe, and to Thomas Booth, his
brother&rsquo;s son; appointing as his executors, Sir Thomas
Scales and John Scales, his sons-in-law.</p>
<p>We have named, above, Edward Goodrick, of East Kirkby.&nbsp;
He died in 1615, and by his will, of 16 August in that year, he
left the bulk of his property to his son Lyon, but &pound;35 from
lands in Suffolk to his daughter Washbourne, besides &pound;400,
in the hands of Sir Thomas Jenney, as her portion; &ldquo;a best
bed&rdquo; to another daughter; and &ldquo;bedsteads of those in
Suffolk,&rdquo; to four other daughters, all married, &ldquo;2
Jacobuses to each as a token of my love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Small sums
are bequeathed to his cousin, Richard Palfreyman, <a
name="citation125b"></a><a href="#footnote125b"
class="citation">[125b]</a> and his godson, Nathaniel Palfreyman;
to his servant John Tupholme 20<sup>s</sup>. besides his wages
13<sup>s</sup>. 4<sup>d</sup>.&nbsp; His &ldquo;grandson John
Godricke to have the manor of Stickney when 22 years old,&rdquo;
and his cousin Richard <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Palfreyman to have it meanwhile;
paying &ldquo;a penny a year to Lyon Godricke.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
will was proved at Horncastle by Lyon Goodrick and Richard
Palfreyman, 25 Oct., 1615.</p>
<p>A name which we cannot omit to notice in connection with East
Kirkby is that of Silkstone; there being a monumental slab in the
parish church of Robert de Silkeston, who died in 1347.&nbsp;
Among 14 documents in the possession of Porter Wilson, Esq., of
Louth, this Robert is a principal party in 13 of them; by which
lands are conveyed to him by Ranulphus, son of Baldwin de Thorpe,
in Ireby; by Robert, son of Philip de Kirkeby, in Kirkby; by
Walter de Kirkby, in Kirkby; by Hugo de Hatton, lands in Kirkby;
by Walter, son of Robert de Langena, lands in Kirkby; Robert, son
of Adam Pertrich, of Bolingbroke; Alan, son of Walter de Kirkeby,
and William, son of Henry de Kirkeby, give him other lands in
Kirkeby; Beatrice, widow of William Wriht, of Miningsby, gives
him lands in Miningsby; John de Waynflet gives him lands in that
parish; and Robert de Swylington, Thomas de Marketon, Rector of
Hareby, and Robert de Miningsby, chaplain, grant to him lands in
&ldquo;Kirkby, Winthorpe, Thorp, Waynflet, Irby, ffriseby
(Firsby), Boston, Leek, Wrangel, Stepying, frrisseneye
(Friskney), Bolynbrok, and Menyngesby,&rdquo; by Deed, given at
Kirkebi, 26 Dec., 29 Ed. III. (1355).&nbsp; Robert de Silkeston
thus became a proprietor of large estates.&nbsp; At a later
period Sir Robert Sylkeston had issue Alicia, who was
&ldquo;maryed to Robert Grynne.&rdquo; <a
name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126"
class="citation">[126]</a>&nbsp; A large portion of the property
passed to that family, and through them to the Skeppers already
mentioned; and from them, by marriage, to the Loddingtons; one of
whom, Thomas Loddington, was Vicar of Horncastle in the early
years of the 18th century; his name being on one of the church
bells with date 1717.</p>
<p>Sir John Browne, knight, resided here for several years,
holding lands in East Kirkby, conveyed to him by Lionel Goodrick
in 1616, and on a dispute arising between him and the Skeppers,
already mentioned, an agreement was made, 20 May, 1619, by which
Sir John granted to Richard Skepper certain property, for 2,000
years, at a <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>peppercorn rent, Richard Skepper in return granting to
Sir John, other lands for a like term and consideration.&nbsp;
(Mr. R. W. Goulding, &ldquo;Linc. N &amp; Q.,&rdquo; vol. v. p.
75).</p>
<p>Some of these lands were known as Bonthelandes, (Boothlands),
West-wang, Wayteclif, Bulgaire, Inge-croft, Langemer-dayles,
Goutscroft, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Sir John Browne was 2nd son of Sir Valentine Browne, of Croft,
&ldquo;Treasurer and Vittler of Barwicke, and Treasurer of
Ireland in ye raigne of Queen Elizabeth,&rdquo; who married
Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Monson, of South Carlton,
ancestor of Lord Oxenbridge.&nbsp; Sir John Browne was
&ldquo;Sergant to King James in his privy chamber.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He married (1) Cicely, daughter of William Kirkman, Esq., of
Easter Keale, who only lived 20 weeks after marriage; and (2),
Francis, daughter of Richard Herbert, Esq., of Montgomerie
Castle.&nbsp; She was youngest sister of George Herbert, who
wrote the well-known poem, &ldquo;The Country Parson,&rdquo; and
of Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, who was so prominent a
figure in the time of Charles I.&nbsp; They were nearly related
to the Pembroke family, and descended from Sir Richard Herbert of
Edwd. IV.&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; There is an elaborate altar tomb in
Croft church, with effigies of Sir Valentine and his lady above;
and of their eight sons and seven daughters on the panels
below.&nbsp; Beside this is an equally elaborate monument of Sir
John and his 2nd wife.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Arcitect. S. Journal,&rdquo;
vol. viii. pp. 70, 71).</p>
<p>Another family, with a good old Saxon name, connected with
East Kirkby, were the Elands (Ea-land or Eyland), representatives
of whom have lived in this parish within quite recent times; the
last of them being William Fawcett Ealand residing at the High
Hall in 1860&ndash;70.&nbsp; The name means Island-land, or water
land. <a name="citation127a"></a><a href="#footnote127a"
class="citation">[127a]</a>&nbsp; Sir William de Eland was
constable of Nottingham castle in 1330, and M.P. for the county
in 1333 (Baily&rsquo;s &ldquo;Annals,&rdquo; vol. i. p.
223).&nbsp; They possessed the &ldquo;Honour of
Peverel.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Baumber church there is a slab of John
Ealand (obiit 1463) and his two wives, in the north aisle. <a
name="citation127b"></a><a href="#footnote127b"
class="citation">[127b]</a>&nbsp; A branch of the family resided
at Raithby near Louth.&nbsp; <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>Toward the close of the 16th
century, one of them resided at Cawkwell, and had that manor and
the advowson of the benefice. <a name="citation128"></a><a
href="#footnote128" class="citation">[128]</a>&nbsp; Others had
estates, and lived at various places in Yorkshire.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the 17th century another family, the
Webberley&rsquo;s of Addlethorpe, resided at East Kirkby.&nbsp;
They intermarried with the Amcotts family, now represented by
Colonel Cracroft Amcotts, of Hackthorne Hall, Lincoln.&nbsp; John
Webberly, who was born here, was a strong partizan of Charles I.,
in his contentions with the Parliament.&nbsp; He did not die for
his King on the field of battle like his compatriot Hallam,
possibly of Bolingbroke (see &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; on Bolingbroke);
but his support of the King, and his religious opinions
(Socinian), subjected him to persecution, and, in 1648, to much
suffering from imprisonment.&nbsp; He was afterwards expelled
from Lincoln College, Oxford.&nbsp; (Weir&rsquo;s History, Ed.
1828, vol. i. p. 415).</p>
<p>The church, dedicated to St. Nicholas, is pronounced by Mr.
Jeans to be &ldquo;one of the most interesting in this district,
though sadly patched with brick, and defaced with ugly
windows.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is no longer used for services, a small
modern church having been recently erected more conveniently near
the village.&nbsp; The varied colouring of the edifice, from the
combination of grey-green crumbling sandstone, with the red tone
of the bricks, surrounded as it is also by lofty trees, render it
a pleasing study for the artist, but its decayed condition
inspires the fear that, unless tenderly dealt with, this
interesting relic, may soon go to decay.&nbsp; It is to be hoped
in the interest of arch&aelig;ology that this may be averted.</p>
<p>The original Saxon church was mostly replaced by a later
fabric, but now ancient, of the 14th century.&nbsp; It consists
of nave, aisles, chancel and tower, having two bells; this tower
probably dating from early in the 13th century, occupies an
unusual position, being attached to the south aisle towards the
west end of it.&nbsp; Its lower storey forms a groined porch,
having a head of the Saviour, rather rudely carved, as the
central top of the vault.&nbsp; It has some early features,
especially the window in its eastern face, but, we quote the late
Precentor Venables, in <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>a description given by him on the
visit of the Architectural Society in 1894.&nbsp; Like the rest
of the fabric, it has been patched and repaired at various
periods, and most of the remains are debased.&nbsp; The
battlemented upper storey is Perpendicular, the fabric generally
being Decorated, of the 14th century.&nbsp; Of the windows,
however, there are few surviving of that period, the west being
the most noticeable.&nbsp; It is of two lights, beautifully
designed, the mask heads of the hood moulding being remnants of
an earlier style.&nbsp; The side windows, both of nave and
chancel, were square-headed.&nbsp; One remains, to the west of
the tower, portions of others remaining among modern
degradations.&nbsp; The eastern windows of both aisles have
flamboyant tracery, but now blocked and partly destroyed.&nbsp;
The blocked arch of an entrance to a north chantry which has been
removed, is seen in the north aisle wall.&nbsp; It must have been
filled in at an early date, as the window inserted is of the
Tudor period.&nbsp; The piscina of this chantry altar, with a
square basin, is still to be seen outside the church.&nbsp; In
the north wall of the chancel, a small two-light window is worth
attention as an excellent example of the purest Decorated.&nbsp;
The south chancel wall has three-light windows, with segmental
heads and super-mullioned tracery of Perpendicular date; one of
these has been removed to form a poor east window, in place of a
good 14th century window, destroyed a few years ago.&nbsp; The
eastern gable is surmounted by a good cross and saddle
stone.&nbsp; The windows of the south aisle are of the meanest
type.&nbsp; There is an arcade of four bays, with Decorated
arches supported on very slender octagonal piers, which are too
tall and slender, and which drive up the arches too high.&nbsp;
The moulded brackets which serve as responds, being elaborately
moulded, deserve notice.&nbsp; The roofs are very poor, being of
a later period; one of the beams bears the date 1583.&nbsp; The
chancel arch has been decapitated and blocked by boarding, but
the rood-screen below is an unusually good specimen of
Perpendicular.&nbsp; It has five bays, the centre being double
the width of the others, and having still its panelled
doors.&nbsp; It is 12ft. 4in. wide, and nearly 18ft. high. <a
name="citation129"></a><a href="#footnote129"
class="citation">[129]</a>&nbsp; (Dr. Mansel Sympson,
&ldquo;Architect. S. Journ.,&rdquo; 1890, p. 209).</p>
<p>Parts of the parclose which formerly enclosed the chantries at
the ends of the aisles, still remain.&nbsp; The <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>Silkstone
chantry on the south retains its decorated trefoil piscina.</p>
<p>In the floor of the south aisle is an incised slab,
commemorative of Sir Robert Silkstone, the builder of the chantry
and church.&nbsp; The late Bishop Trollope&rsquo;s rendering of
the Latin inscription, which is somewhat defaced, the slab being
broken into four pieces, is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Here is
buried Sir Robert Silkstone.&nbsp; He erected this church and
chantry.&nbsp; He departed hence in 1347, and on the 14th of June
lost his life.&nbsp; To whom may God ever grant rest in
Heaven.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tradition is that he died an
untimely death, if not by his own hand.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N.
&amp; Q.,&rdquo; 1896, p. 50).</p>
<p>The old oak seating remains at the west end, and there are
fragments, scattered about, of other screen-work.&nbsp; In the
north wall of the chancel is a narrow trefoil-headed recess,
thought by some to be an Easter sepulchre; it has a curious
carved panel, with three kneeling figures, supposed to be the
three Maries, each holding a heart.&nbsp; The recess is an
aumbrey, intended for the Host.&nbsp; The projecting basin, which
Mr. Bloxam thought was a receptacle for &ldquo;creeping
silver,&rdquo; is a piscina and the so-called carved
&ldquo;hearts&rdquo; are boxes for spice.&nbsp; This portion of
the service of the Mass is referred to by Barnaby Googe (1570),
in the lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;While frankincense and sweet perfume<br />
Before the shrine they burn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The font is a good sample of Perpendicular, having a panelled
octagonal bowl, supported on a panelled shaft, standing on a
platform of steps; the panels contain heads and flowers.&nbsp;
There are fragments of old stained glass scattered about the
windows, and old encaustic tiles in the floor.&nbsp; A St.
Edmund&rsquo;s penny was found some years ago on the north side
of the church, which the late Vicar, the Rev. G. Maughan,
pronounced to have been issued before <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 905.&nbsp; Not far distant, in the
year 1899, on some cottages being pulled down, there were found
some fragments of dog-tooth pattern, and portions of columns and
capitals, which are supposed to have come originally from
Revesby; these are now in the garden of Mr. T. Coltman, at
Hagnaby Priory.</p>
<p>The chantry on the north side of the church formerly existing,
was called the Jesus Chapel.&nbsp; Here was buried William
Goodrick, father of the Bishop of Ely, at his own <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>request, by
his will dated 20 March, 1517, to be buried &ldquo;in the chapell

Mucton, priest, to this chantry (then newly founded), and on Kal.
June 1346, he presented &ldquo;Rob., son of John Fowler, of
Mithingsby, priest, to the same chantry.&rdquo;&nbsp;

<h3><span class="smcap">Lusby</span>.</h3>
<p>Lusby (called in Domesday Book Lodeby and Luzebi), is distant
from Horncastle about 6 miles, in an easterly direction, being 1
mile beyond Winceby.&nbsp; Prior to the Norman Conquest, the
Saxon Thane, Tonna, held lands here, as well as in other parishes
in the neighbourhood, his property here being 3 carucates, or
about 360 acres (Domesday).&nbsp; Other owners of land were
Almer, and his brother John, and his son Mauger.&nbsp; These, at
the Conquest, were mostly superseded by Normans.&nbsp; William
the Conqueror gave to his nephew Gilbert de Gaunt, son of
Baldwin, Earl of Flanders, whose sister was William&rsquo;s
Consort, 113 Manors in Lincolnshire, besides several in other
counties, among them being Lusby, the adjoining Hagworthingham,
and Grantham (Greetham), &amp;c.&nbsp; The property would seem,
however, to have been only held by the Gaunts for three
generations.&nbsp; In 1223 we find Simon de Kyme instituting a
suit in the King&rsquo;s Court to recover <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>certain
lands in Lusby, as being the descendant and lawful representative
and heir of the aforesaid Almar.&nbsp; He failed, however, to
establish his case.&nbsp; (Curia Regis, Roll No. 82, Hilary, 7
Henry III.)&nbsp; He still, however, held lands in Langton and
Sausthorpe; and he must also have had other lands in Lusby, as we
find that in the 9th year of King John he granted the fee of 1
knight to Walter de Bec, &ldquo;to have and to hold of the same
Simon and his heirs for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superior lord, however, of all these parties, would seem
to have been the Bishop of Durham, a powerful and wealthy
prelate.&nbsp; Early in the 12th century (circa 1114) we find
that Ranulph, Bishop of Durham, held in chief, lands in Lusby,
and several other parishes in the neighbourhood, and one Pinson
was tenant under him at Lusby, holding by the service of acting
as the bishop&rsquo;s bailiff.&nbsp; Whether this Pinson was the
same as Pinso, sworn brother in arms of Eudo, the Norman lord of
Tattershall, is not clear; but it seems likely, as the Bishop of
Durham, his over-lord, also held lands in Tattershall.&nbsp;
(N.B.&mdash;The author of &ldquo;The History of Spilsby,&rdquo;
Rev. H. Cotton-Smith, says that he was; p. 24).&nbsp; But through
the Pinsons, Lusby, Winceby, and other manors passed to another
family, already named, which for some time held an important
position in the county, the Beks or Becs.&nbsp; There is some
confusion in the different records of the earlier generations of
this family.&nbsp; Walter de Bek was the scion of a family of
Norman blood, whose ancestor, according to Sir William Dugdale in
his &ldquo;Baronage,&rdquo; had &ldquo;a faire inheritance in
Flanders,&rdquo; but came over with the Conqueror.&nbsp; This
Walter de Bec married Agnes, daughter of Hugh Pinson, the
steward, and had by her five sons, Hugh, Henry, Walter, John, and
Thomas.&nbsp; Of these, Henry succeeded to the manors of Eresby,
Spilsby, Scrivelsby, and Wispington; and Walter became
&ldquo;Lord of Lusceby, Wynceby, Neuton (<i>i.e.</i> Wold Newton)
and ffoulstow (Fulstow).&rdquo;&nbsp; (Lansdown MSS. 207, cf.,
453).&nbsp; The Becs were a family of great influence.&nbsp; Of
two brothers, one, Anthony, was Bishop of Durham, the other,
Thomas, was Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s, and another Anthony, was
Bishop of Norwich, his brother being Bishop of Lincoln, in days
when Bishops were statesmen and even soldiers, as well as proud
prelates.&nbsp; Walter was Constable of the Castle of Lincoln
(Harleyan MSS, f. 23).</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>In
the old documents called &ldquo;Final Concords,&rdquo; p. 80.,
under date &ldquo;17 May, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1208,&rdquo; we find Walter Bec, named as &ldquo;tenant of one
knight&rsquo;s fee in Lusceby.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1300 <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> Sir John Bek, like his father, was
Constable of Lincoln Castle, but also holding the additional
office of Constable of Bristol.&nbsp; He made a grant to the
Priory of Bullington, near Wragby, which is worthy of notice, as
its terms are peculiar.&nbsp; It runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I,
John son of Walter Beck, of Lusceby, have granted, &amp;c., for
ever to prior and convent of Bolington, for the safety of my
soul, and the souls of my ancestors, two selions of land,
&amp;c., which formerly, Simon, merchant of Burgh, held of me for
one pair of white gloves.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have mention, in the
case of High Toynton, of land, held by the tenure of a pair of
spurs, presented annually to the lord, as rent; here we have a no
less singular tenure, by the gift of a pair of gloves.&nbsp; The
knightly gauntlet was probably in those days a more costly
article than a nineteenth or twentieth century glove.&nbsp; In
illustration of the above peculiar tenure, we may notice the
legacy of Baron Bec&rsquo;s &ldquo;gauntlets&rdquo; to
Kirkstead.&nbsp; This John, son of Walter, was created first
Baron Bec of Eresby; he obtained a license to fortify his castle
at Eresby, 1295.&nbsp; By his will, dated July 20, 1301, he
ordered his body to be buried at Kirkstead, whereunto he gives
his best horse, his mail coat, &ldquo;gauntlets,&rdquo; harness
of iron, lance, targe and other accoutrements.&nbsp; His daughter
married Sir William Willoughby.</p>
<p>Most of the property of the Lusby Beks passed, a generation or
two later, to another branch of the family, the Becks of Eresby;
whose descendant, John Willoughby, through the marriage of Baron
Bec&rsquo;s daughter to Sir William Willoughby, in the reign of
Edwd. III., held the manors of &ldquo;Hareby, Lusceby, Ester
Kele, Wester Kele,&rdquo; &amp;c.; and thus the property passed
to the ancestors of the present Earl of Ancaster, and Lord
Willoughby d&rsquo; Eresby.&nbsp; We still, however, find (by
Feet of Fines, Lincoln, file 69) that in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1302, John Bek had &ldquo;the rent
of 6 quarters of salt, <a name="citation133"></a><a
href="#footnote133" class="citation">[133]</a> in Wispington,
Marton next Horncastle, Langtone, Wodehalle, Thymelby,
Scrivelsby,&rdquo; and other parishes, &ldquo;with advowson of
the church of Wispington.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Henry <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>Bek, of
Pusseby (Lusby), sold to Lord Stephen de Langton, Archbishop of
Canterbury, lands and tenement in ffowlestow; which same bishop
gave the said manor to Beatrice, his sister, who was married to
Alan de Normanby.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Lansdowne MSS. 207, cf.,
453).&nbsp; For these details of the Becks, I am chiefly indebted
to a paper, by Rev. W. O. Massingberd, in the &ldquo;Architect.
Soc. Journal,&rdquo; for 1897.</p>
<p>To show that the Becs were not confined to the neighbourhood
of Eresby and Lusby, I may mention that, not only are their
armorial quarterings found, as was to be expected, in Spilsby
church, but according to Gervase Holles&rsquo; &ldquo;Notes on
Churches,&rdquo; they formerly existed in windows in the churches
of Coningsby and Langton-by-Horncastle, and probably many
others.&nbsp; (Harleyan MSS., 6829.)</p>
<p>Of later proprietors of Lusby, I am not able to give any,
except that, in a List (given in the Melbourne Hall MSS.) of
Gentry, of the 16th century, who furnished launces and light
horses, when the country was preparing to give a warm reception
to the expected Spanish Armada, I find that Mr. Palfreyman of
Lusby, gent., attended the muster at the Horncastle Sessions in
1586, and furnished 1 launce and 1 light horse, when his
neighbour, Mr. Langton, of Langton, and Augustine Cavendish, of
Orby, furnished each 1 light horse, but no lance; John Littlebury
of Hagworthingham, furnishing 2 light horses and no lance.&nbsp;
Mr. Maddison explains that this Mr. Palfreyman would be a
descendant of William Palfreyman, who was Mayor of Lincoln in
1536.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Arch. Soc. Journ.&rdquo; 1894, pp. 214,
220).</p>
<p>In Liber Regis we also find the names of those who presented
to the benefice, and therefore were in some way connected with
the place; George Davenport in 1699, Carr Brackenbury in 1720,
and Robert Carr Brackenbury in 1780.&nbsp; In recent times the
bishops of Lincoln seem to have inherited the position formerly
held by the bishops of Durham, as owners of the soil and lords of
the manor; and these are now in the hands of the Ecclesiastical
Commissions.</p>
<p>We now come to speak of the church, dedicated to St.
Peter.&nbsp; At the date of Domesday Book, this was one of the
222 parishes in the county which possessed a church.&nbsp; A
priest is also there named, doubtless one of the 131 only
resident presbyters in the county; many of the churches <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>being
served by the &ldquo;Religious&rdquo; of the convents.&nbsp;
There is also mention of a mill, worth 3<i>s.</i> yearly. <a
name="citation135"></a><a href="#footnote135"
class="citation">[135]</a></p>
<p>There was thus at Lusby a church at that early period, and it,
as well as Winceby, paid a pension to the Bardney Monastery,
probably through the connection with Gilbert de Gaunt, that
Norman noble being one of Bardney&rsquo;s most generous patrons,
and the re-founder of that institution after it had been in a
state of decay for some 200 years.&nbsp; Ecton&rsquo;s Thesaurus
gives the pension as 30<i>s.</i>, a fairly large sum in those
days.</p>
<p>The present very interesting church is, in parts, so very
ancient, that it is more than likely that some portions of the
original fabric of that day still remain.&nbsp; Only a few years
ago the building was in a state of squalid neglect and
architectural disfigurement; but it was restored by the
Commissioners in 1892, and re-opened by the Bishop of Lincoln on
January 17, 1893, the work having been done with great care and
judgment; and the former flat-ceiled, white-washed room has given
place to a structure church-like in all its arrangements.&nbsp;
It is nevertheless of a somewhat conglomerate character, windows,
and other objects, breaking out, as it were, in all sorts of
unexpected positions; and thus making it a study of
curiosities.&nbsp; We quote here some of the remarks of the late
Precentor Venables made on the occasion of the visit of the
Architectural Society in 1894, &ldquo;of the original Norman
fabric, itself of more than one date, and which was shortened at
the west end, there are several relics, especially in the
charming narrow doorway in the north wall of the nave, now built
up, the arch of which is surrounded with zigzag moulding; and a
very remarkable little &lsquo;key-hole&rsquo; window, high up in
the north wall of the chancel.&nbsp; An incised line which runs
round the head of this ends in volutes, and above it is a small
incised cross.&nbsp; Holes in the jamb of the shutter indicate
that this widow was originally unglazed.&nbsp; Opposite the north
doorway are traces of another Norman doorway in the south wall,
also now blocked, having above it a <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>cross with round
medallions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eastward in this same south wall of the
nave is a two-light early English window with quatrefoil above,
in the eastern splay of which, inside the church, is a small, but
&ldquo;singularly fine corbel head, crowned.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Immediately eastward of the chancel arch in the south wall of the
chancel is a small square window, possibly a squint; and east of
this a very narrow small &ldquo;lancet window has been
opened,&rdquo; and still east of this, at a different elevation,
there is a good two-light decorated window.&nbsp; The chancel
arch is round-headed and plain; on either side of it are a pair
of Norman pillars, with the capitals hacked away; those on the
north side partly retain their rounded columns.&nbsp; There is a
perpendicular screen across the chancel arch of three
compartments above with ogee arches and richly carved finials,
the central compartment being open; and below are two panels on
either side the central open compartment, having ogee arches
within semi-circular rims.&nbsp; On the north side of the chancel
arch is a niche for a figure.&nbsp; In the north wall of the
chancel is an aumbrey, and an oblong one above it; and in the
south wall a square one corresponding.&nbsp; In the south wall,
under the easternmost window, is an easter sepulchre a plain
semi-circular arched recess, probably marking the tomb of the
founder.&nbsp; In the north wall of the nave is a similar, but
rather larger recess.&nbsp; The east window has three lights,
quatrefoiled, with trefoiled compartments above, and a quatrefoil
above these.&nbsp; The west door is square-headed with a low arch
within; over this a three-light quatrefoiled widow with
square-headed moulding above; and over this, in the gable, a
square, slit widow, above which hangs the one bell in a large
turret.&nbsp; The font on the north side of the west door, is
modern, circular, massive, of Caen stone.&nbsp; The sittings are
of deal; the pulpit, lectern, and chancel sedilia, of modern oak;
the roof throughout of pitch pine.&nbsp; There is a small brass
tablet of date circa 1600, with eight English rhyming lines,
forming a dialogue between a deceased wife and her surviving
husband.&nbsp; The stones of the walls are of all sizes and
shapes, and the massive western buttresses are 5ft. thick.&nbsp;
The benefice, a rectory, is now held with that of Hagworthingham,
and is in the incumbency of the Rev. G. R. Ekins, who resides at
the latter place.</p>
<p>Letters, <i>via</i> Spilsby, arrive at 8 a.m., and are

<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span><span
class="smcap">Asgarby</span>, which is ecclesiastically annexed
to the benefice of Lusby, lies about six miles south-east of
Horncastle, being about a mile south by east of Winceby, by which
it is reached from Horncastle, and about a mile west of
Lusby.&nbsp; Letters, via Spilsby, arrive at 8.30 a.m.&nbsp; The
nearest money order office is at Old Bolingbroke, and the nearest
telegraph office at East Kirkby, about 5 miles distant.&nbsp; The
whole parish comprises about 760 acres, divided into two farms,
the property of Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and occupied
respectively, Asgarby Hall farm by Mr. M. Dunham, and the Asgarby
House farm by Mr. W. H. Robinson, both these residences being
substantial structures of considerable age.&nbsp; It has been
asked &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo; yet the name Asgarby
would seem significant.&nbsp; Its elements are &ldquo;as&rdquo;
(or Aes), &ldquo;gar&rdquo; (guard or garth), <a
name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137"
class="citation">[137]</a> and &ldquo;by&rdquo;; the first of
these implying the presence of &ldquo;water,&rdquo; the second
meaning, &ldquo;an enclosure&rdquo;; and the third &ldquo;a
building&rdquo;; thus we have, as the meaning of the whole,
&ldquo;a water-enclosed building,&rdquo; or moated
residence.&nbsp; The hall stands on an elevation, commanding an
extensive view, and there are various hollows and banks still
existing, which probably indicate the moat which at one time
surrounded a more important building than the present hall.&nbsp;
This is confirmed by the stews, or fish-ponds, lying westward
below the hall, which imply that the establishment required an
extensive fish diet, on the numerous Romish fast days.&nbsp; The
demesne is given in Domesday Book, along with Hareby, Mavis
Enderby, Raithby, and many others, which became the property of
Ivo Taillebois, by his marriage with the Lady Lucia, daughter of
the powerful Saxon Earl Alfgar, father-in-law of King
Harold.&nbsp; It probably passed at a later period to the Bishops
of Durham, who held many lordships in the neighbourhood; and
ultimately came to the Bishops of Lincoln, who were lords of the
manor, until the transference in 1862, of episcopal property to
the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who have since that time, owned
the estate.</p>
<p>The Benefice, now worth &pound;40 a year, is described in
Liber Regis, as a curacy.&nbsp; It, however, gives its name to a
prebendal stall in Lincoln Cathedral.&nbsp; The church, <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>dedicated
to St. Swithin, is an unpretending structure, of no architectural
merit; but since it was re-seated, with deal fittings, in 1882,
it has been kept, to say the least, in a neat condition.&nbsp; It
is doubtless one of the smallest parish churches in the kingdom,
the nave being slightly over 20ft. in length, and the chancel
about 9ft.&nbsp; The east window has two lights, in debased
style.&nbsp; There is a three-light debased window in the north
wall, and a corresponding one in the south wall.&nbsp; The pulpit
is of modern oak.&nbsp; There is a tablet on the south nave wall
in memory of Sarah, wife of John Parkinson, &ldquo;greatly
admired for her virtue, frugality, and charity,&rdquo; who died
17 May, 1816; also in memory of John Parkinson, her husband, who
died May 15, 1821.</p>
<p>In the north wall of the chancel is a memorial tablet of the
Rev. W. Ward, Incumbent, who died 26 Nov., 1846.&nbsp; The one
bell hangs in a turret over the west door.&nbsp; The register
dates from 1575.&nbsp; Canon Oldfield, who holds the benefice,
with that of Lusby, is also Rector of Hagworthingham, where he
resides.&nbsp; Asgarby Benefice is now held with Lusby, by Rev.
C. E. Bolam.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Miningsby</span>.</h3>
<p>Miningsby is situated about 7 miles from Horncastle in a
south-easterly direction, and is approached by way of
Mareham-on-the-Hill and Hameringham.&nbsp; It is seven miles from
Spilsby westward, and 9 miles north-east of Tattershall
Station.&nbsp; Letters, <i>via</i> Boston, arrive at 9 a.m.&nbsp;
The nearest money order and telegraph office is at East
Kirkby.</p>
<p>In the time of the Conqueror, this manor belonged to his
nephew, Ivo Taillebois, through his marriage with the Lady Lucia,
the rich heiress of the Saxon Thorolds.&nbsp; It is stated in
Domesday Book to comprise 6 carucates of land rateable to gelt
(<i>i.e.</i>, 720 acres), worked by thirty-six soke-men, eight
villeins, and 4 bordars, who had also 40 acres of meadow, <a
name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138"
class="citation">[138]</a> which is several acres in excess of
the present measurement.</p>
<p>Miningsby was connected with Spalding Priory in the following
manner.&nbsp; That monastery was founded by Thorold de Buchenale
(<i>i.e.</i>, Bucknall, near Horncastle), <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 952; <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>and the Lady Lucia, his niece and
heiress, in conjunction with her husband Ivo Taillebois (who was
Lord of Spalding), added largely to the original endowment from
her uncle.&nbsp; The churches of Bolingbroke, Stickney, and other
parishes, with &ldquo;half the Church of East Keal,&rdquo; were
given to the priory; also tithes from Claxby, Edlington, Minting,
Gautby, &amp;c., and &ldquo;temporalities&rdquo; from Haltham,
Bolingboke, Miningsby, &amp;c., the latter including two
carucates (or 240 acres) of land in Miningsby.&nbsp; On the
Dissolution of the Monasteries, by Henry VIII., several of these
properties passed to the crown, and became connected with the
Duchy of Lancaster, and the &ldquo;Honour of
Bolingbroke.&rdquo;&nbsp; We mention in the Notes on Revesby, and
other parishes, how those and other lands, passed, through the
Lady Lucia&rsquo;s son (by her 2nd husband), William de Romara,
to the Abbey of Revesby, and at a later period to the Stanhopes,
and, by a parallel process, although through a distinct channel,
the Stanhopes are now lords of the manor of Miningsby, and own
most of the soil.</p>
<p>Frequent mention is made of Miningsby in the ancient Revesby
Abbey charters. <a name="citation139"></a><a href="#footnote139"
class="citation">[139]</a>&nbsp; By charters No. 1 B. and C.,
William de Romara conveys to the abbey, 23 acres of land in
Miningsby, as well as common pasture in the same.&nbsp; Among the
witnesses to the latter, is Baldric de Cheles, a name still
represented in the neighbourhood, by the family of the Rev. Alan
Cheales, rector of Friskney, and owner of land in Hagworthingham,
&amp;c.&nbsp; By charter No. 7 C., Hugo Wac confirms to the Abbot
of Revesby &ldquo;two oxgangs (or 30 acres) of land in Miningsby
with right of pasturage and the hermitage, which Ranulph the Monk
made in Halton marsh.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Hugo Wac, would seem to
be a representative of the ancient Lincolnshire Saxon family of
the Wakes, whose most distinguished member was &ldquo;Hereward
the Wake,&rdquo; lord of Bourne, the last hero of Anglo-Saxon
independence, whose &ldquo;Camp of Refuge&rdquo; for some time
defied the Conqueror, and whose exploits have been celebrated in
prose and verse.&nbsp; By charter No. 39, Alan son of Ranulph, of
Miningsby, gives 2 perches of meadow in &ldquo;Sud Bec&rdquo;
(south beck) in Miningsby, free of all service and claims (temp.
Henry II. or Richard I.)&nbsp; We may mention here that this
Miningsby beck is now <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>the chief feeder of the reservoir
which furnishes Boston with its water supply.&nbsp; By charter
No. 40 B., Richard I. confirms to the monks of Revesby certain
lands and possessions in Miningsby, Kirkby, Claxby, Mareham,
&amp;c.&nbsp; This is witnessed by Hubert Walter, Archbishop of
Canterbury, Robert de Harecourt and others.&nbsp; By No. 41, a
plot of land in Miningsby is given &ldquo;for the use of the
gate-monk, and for gate alms,&rdquo; at the abbey, by William,
son of Roger de Bikinghesby (Wilksby?) temp. Richard I. or
John.&nbsp; By No. 59, William Helle, of Miningsby, gives the
right of pasturage for 60 sheep in Miningsby, free of all
claim.&nbsp; By No. 63, William, son of Ivo, of Kirkby, gives
land adjoining the place from which the sand was taken for
building Miningsby church, near &ldquo;Crosbesich.&rdquo;&nbsp;
By No. 115, William, son of John Barette, of Stickney, residing
at Miningsby, gives one perch of meadow, &ldquo;for the
maintenance of two candles always burning in the Abbey
Chapel.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Date Henry III. or Ed. I.)&nbsp; By No.
119, Nicholas, son of Roger Herod of Miningsby, gives &ldquo;one
meadow, free of all claims,&rdquo; and stipulates that &ldquo;the
monks shall pay annually one penny towards maintaining the light
before the image of St. Nicholas, in Kirkby church, every St.
Nicholas Day.&rdquo;&nbsp; By No. 131, Alan of Miningsby, gives
&ldquo;one selion, <a name="citation140"></a><a
href="#footnote140" class="citation">[140]</a> and four
akerheveds&rdquo; of land in Miningsby, in two places, called
&ldquo;Hankes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Claxby dale,&rdquo; free of all
claim (date, Ed. I.)&nbsp; By charter No. 150 B., the King, Henry
VIII., grants to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, all rights and
property, hitherto belonging to the monastery of Revesby, in
Miningsby, Moorby, Wood Enderby, Wilksby, East Kirkby, and many
other places, &ldquo;having come into our hands by reason of the
dissolution of the said monastery.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Duke&rsquo;s
title is to date from March 1, in the 29th year of our reign,
<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1538.&nbsp; (British Museum,
additional MSS. 24805, fol. 32).</p>
<p>Among &ldquo;Lincolnshire Wills,&rdquo; we find Richard
Skepper, of East Kirkby, in his will, dated 26 May, 1556,
mentioning among other land, which he devises, certain copyhold
lands in Miningsby.</p>
<p>By will, dated 22 Dec. 1615, Robert Hustwait, of Great
Grimsby, makes his brother, Edward Hustwait, of Miningsbye, and
his cousin, Tristram Smith, of Awdbee Grange, supervisors, and
gives them twenty shillings each.&nbsp; <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>The
Husthwaites were above the yeoman class, but not important enough
to appear in the Visitations of the Heralds; they intermarried

<p>By a Chancery Inquisition post mortem, 23 Henry VII., No. 78
(<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1507&ndash;8), taken at
Horncastle, Jan. 14th, John Parke of Mynyngesby, John Skayman, of
Mynyngesby, being among the jurors, it was shewn that Thomas, the
Abbott of Revesby, was entitled to hold from the King, among
other lands, 10 acres of arable land and 4 acres of meadow,
called &ldquo;Symondes lands&rdquo; in Mynyngesby

notwithstanding the Statute of Mortmain.</p>
<p>By a Feet of Fines, Lincoln, file 68 (32), 30 Edw. I., Robert

Beatrix, wife of William Wriht of Mythingesby, quitclaims to
Robert de Silkeston, and Robert, son of Isabella Skells (Scales),
all her right in the lands and tenements in Mythingesby, which
they held of the gift of the said William her late husband.&nbsp;
Given at Kyrkeby juxta Bolingbrok, on Thursday next before the

<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>By a
Deed, dated 19 May, 24 Henry VI. (1446), Henry the King orders
that certain rents for lands in Est Kirkby, Menyngesby, &amp;c.,

(&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; vol. v. p. 89.)</p>
<p>According to Liber Regis, there was formerly a charge of
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> annually on certain lands in Miningsby,
towards the repairs of the church windows.</p>
<p>The Church, dedicated to St. Andrew, consists of nave, chancel
and a double bell-gable at the west end.&nbsp; It was restored at
the expense of J. Banks Stanhope, Esq., in 1878, when nearly the
whole fabric was taken down by the architect, the late Mr. James
Fowler, of Louth, and carefully reconstructed so as to preserve
its most interesting features.&nbsp; The stone then employed is
already (1901) showing signs of decay.&nbsp; The south wall of
the nave retains portions of an earlier Norman building, viz.,
one Norman window and a semi-circular headed doorway, set flush
with the wall, enclosing a later pointed arch, also set flush. <a
name="citation142a"></a><a href="#footnote142a"
class="citation">[142a]</a>&nbsp; The chancel is early English,
with lancet windows, in the east end and side walls; there is
also a lancet window in the north wall of the nave.&nbsp; There
was formerly a chantry in the north side of the church, the arch
of which is now blocked.&nbsp; In the west wall are two tall
trefoil windows.&nbsp; The font is perpendicular, with octagonal
embattled bowl, supported by four columns with square flowers in
the capitals.&nbsp; The chancel is separated from the nave by a
good open rood screen, containing portions of the original.&nbsp;
The whole interior presents a well-ordered church appearance. <a
name="citation142b"></a><a href="#footnote142b"
class="citation">[142b]</a>&nbsp; The object, however, of special
interest here, is a so-called &ldquo;Runic&rdquo; stone, covered
with the involuted &ldquo;knot,&rdquo; or &ldquo;figure of
eight&rdquo; pattern.&nbsp; Not many years ago it formed the
threshold of a door, but was rescued by the Rev. G. Maughan,
rector of East Kirkby, when he had charge of this parish, who had
it placed <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>against the north wall of the chancel.&nbsp; It is
fortunately still in a very fair condition, with the exception of
a portion gone from one end, and a crack towards the other
end.&nbsp; There are, or were recently, two other specimens in
the neighbourhood, one, a fragment at Lusby, and the other at
Mavis Enderby.&nbsp; The Lusby fragment is said to have been
Norman.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; vol. iv. p.
225).&nbsp; That at Mavis Enderby, now used as a church door
step, and the pattern, consequently much defaced, is, like this
at Miningsby, said to be of pre-Norman style, though not
necessarily pre-Norman date.&nbsp; The former, however, is coped,
while the latter is flat.&nbsp; The Rev. G. Maughan believed that
there was another similar stone within the same chancel wall,
but, as that part of the fabric was not taken down by the
architect, it was not exposed to view.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N.
&amp; Q.&rdquo; vol. iii. p. 157.)&nbsp; The frill border of the
Miningsby stone is decidedly Saxon in character.&nbsp; It is 44
inches long, by 19&frac12; wide, and 6in. thick.&nbsp; These
stones are specially interesting and far from common.&nbsp;
Interlaced work was an ancient Hittite ornament, as shewn in a
seal, engraved in the &ldquo;Arch&aelig;ological Journal,&rdquo;
vol. xliv. p. 348.&nbsp; Specimens are found, however, in Italy,
Greece, France, as well as similar patterns in Saxon, Lombardic,
and Spanish MSS.&nbsp; The stones are more common in Ireland than
in England.&nbsp; Several are found like the Iona cross in
Scotland, probably imported from Ireland, by the missionaries of
St. Columba.&nbsp; There is an excellent sketch of the Miningsby
stone, by the Rev. J. A. Penny, vicar of Wispington, in
&ldquo;Lincolnshire Notes and Queries,&rdquo; vol. iv., p.
225.</p>
<p>After the Reformation, the earliest presentation which we find
to this benefice is that of William Clerke, by King Edward VI.
(as Duke of Lancaster); he was instituted as rector, 4, Edwd.
VI., <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1550&ndash;1.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Architect. S. Journal,&rdquo; 1897, p. 23.)</p>
<p>Recent rectors have been the Rev. E. Repton, in the earlier
years of the century; the Rev. W. Nevins, later; and the Rev. H.
Caukwell, appointed in 1878.&nbsp; The register dates from 1688,
earlier records being lost.&nbsp; The children have a right to go
to the free school of East Kirkby.</p>
<p>There is a modern commodious house, occupied by the present
rector, who has 170 acres of glebe; but it is remarkable that
about 100 acres of glebe are missing; <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>the award made by the commissioners
in lieu of tithe being largely in excess of the land now attached
to the benefice.&nbsp; This parish also contains about 100 acres
of charity land belonging to Stamford school.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Oxcombe</span>.</h3>
<p>This parish is situated about 7 miles, in a north-easterly
direction from Horncastle, and about the same distance south-west
from Louth.&nbsp; It is interesting to notice that in the name of
this parish we have one of the few survivals in the county of its
former British inhabitants.&nbsp; The old writer, William Camden,
Clarenceaux King of Arms, in his &ldquo;Remaines concerning
Britain,&rdquo; p. 116, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1657,
says &ldquo;Combe, a word in use both in France and England, for
a valley between high hills.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is, in fact, the
term still common in the south of England for a secluded valley,
as in such names as Pyecombe, in Sussex, a village nestling in a
hollow at the base of the south Downs; Combe Pyne, and Combe
Martin, in Devonshire, and many another similar name, as well as
in the old Welsh (or British) &ldquo;cwm,&rdquo; which occurs in
many a name in Wales, of places situated in like hill-locked
positions.&nbsp; And this exactly describes the situation of
Oxcombe, a valley almost cup-shaped, surrounded by steep hills,
the whole parish now forming one estate, of something over 1,000
acres in extent, lying in a ring fence.</p>
<p>In Domesday Book it is also called Oxetune, in which the
suffix &ldquo;tune,&rdquo; or &ldquo;ton,&rdquo; is the later
Saxon for inclosure, implying a secluded farmstead, where some
Saxon Thane&rsquo;s cattle were housed.&nbsp; In that record of
the Norman Conqueror, of which the date for Lincolnshire is about
1085 <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, this parish is mentioned
twice, once, as connected with the manor of Fulletby, which was
among the lands conferred by William the Conqueror, on the Bishop
of Durham, William de Karilepho, a Norman, who was a favourite
with that king, and was appointed by him Chief Justice of
England; and once among the possessions of the Norman noble, Hugh
de Abrinchis (or Avranches), who was nephew of the Conqueror,
and, besides being endowed by him with the Barony of the whole
county of <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>Chester, held also nearly one hundred and fifty manors
in this County and elsewhere.&nbsp; He was surnamed Lupus or
&ldquo;The Wolf&rdquo; (as has been stated in other of these
records) from the many deeds of violence, for which he was famed;
and for which he endeavoured to atone in the closing years of his
somewhat lawless life, by becoming a monk in the Abbey of St.
Werberg, at Chester, which he had himself founded.</p>
<p>The part of this manor, held by the Bishop of Durham, was
combined with Fulletby, the adjoining parish westward, and was,
under the Bishop, farmed by socmen, or free tenants.&nbsp; The
portion belonging to Lupus was held by him, as in the soke of
Farforth, another adjoining parish eastward, and was also farmed
by socmen.</p>
<p>Hugh de Abrincis left one son, who succeeded to his estates;
but, as we have elsewhere observed, the tenure of land was, in
those unsettled times, very precarious, and we have evidence that
lands in Oxcombe, at an early date, passed into other
hands.&nbsp; The land became in part the property of Bullington
Priory, which was an off-shoot of the Gilbertine Priory, of
Sempingham, famous for the severity of its monastic rules.&nbsp;
Bullington Priory was founded by Simon Fitzwilliam, <a
name="citation145a"></a><a href="#footnote145a"
class="citation">[145a]</a> in the reign of Stephen, and endowed
with various lands in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; These endowments
were augmented by William de Kyme, a member of another powerful
family in the county, who had also lands at Sotby, and elsewhere;
and further additions were made by the Crevec&oelig;urs, <a
name="citation145b"></a><a href="#footnote145b"
class="citation">[145b]</a> a family of much importance from the
time of the Norman Conquest, Sir Hamon de Crevec&oelig;ur
succeeding to the barony of the Abrincis, located in Kent, with
the title of Barons of Folkstone; while in this immediate
neighbourhood, they held the lands in Somersby and Bag
Enderby.&nbsp; A few old records exist showing ownership in
Oxcombe, at an early date, by several other parties.</p>
<p><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>By an
agreement made under date, 15 June, 1202, between Matilda, wife
of Richard de Ormsby, on the one part, and Walter Futenglaz,
tenant of certain lands in Oxcombe, the said Walter, on his part,
acknowledged the said lands to be the right and inheritance of
Matilda; and in return Matilda granted them to Walter, to hold to
him and his heirs, of the said Matilda, and her heirs for ever,
by the service of 12<i>d.</i> by the year; and for this grant,
the said Walter gave her &frac12; mark.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Final
Concords.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>We next get a connection of this parish with the Priories of
Sempringham and Bullington, already referred to.&nbsp; By an
agreement, dated 20 April, 1203, between Roger, Prior of
Sempringham, and William de Oxecumbe, touching lands in the
parish, the said William &ldquo;warranted to the said prior and
his successors, the charters which the same prior had of William,
father of the said William, and all the said lands; and he
granted them to hold to the said prior and his successors, and to
the church of the blessed Mary of Bulinton, and to the Nuns and
the Brethren serving God there, in pure and perpetual alms, free
of all secular service and exaction.&rdquo;&nbsp; And for this
grant and warrant, the prior gave the said William 2 marks.</p>
<p>Another document introduces a member of an important family
holding considerable possessions in Yorkshire and
elsewhere.&nbsp; It is an agreement, dated 26 April, 1214,
between Robert de Malo Lacu and Emma his wife, on the one part,
and Robert de Oxecumbe and others, among them being Walter Bec,
on the other part, concerning the right to certain lands which
Walter Bec &ldquo;acknowledges to be the right of the said Robert
de Malo Lacu, and Emma, his wife,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; In return
for which they grant to the said Walter, 12 oxgangs of land, here
and elsewhere, &ldquo;to have and to hold to him and his heirs
for ever, doing the service of five parts of a knight&rsquo;s
fee.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Walter Bec would appear to have been a
member of the wealthy family who are mentioned in the Records of
Spilsby and Lusby, as holding large property in those parishes
and elsewhere, and as being ancestors of the Lords of
Willoughby.&nbsp; The de Malo Lacu family, otherwise de Mauley
were powerful Normans; the head of the race, Peter de Malo Lacu
being born at Poictou in France.&nbsp; He, coming over to England
in the reign of Henry III., built the castle of Mountgrace, in
the East Riding of Yorkshire.&nbsp; Camden, states that there
were eight Peters in <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>succession who held these estates,
the last of them leaving two daughters, one of whom married
Bigot, a member of the family of the Earl Marechal, of England;
the other married a member of the knightly family of Salvain, and
the de Mauley estates were divided between these two
families.&nbsp; The arms of the Lords de Malo Lacu were a bend,
sable, on an escutcheon, or.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Hist. of Meux
Abbey,&rdquo; quoted Camden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; pp.
751, &amp;c.)</p>
<p>By deed, dated 25 November, 1218, in a dispute between the
same Matilda, wife of Richard Ormesby, and William, Prior of
Bolinton, concerning the advowson of the church of Oxecumb, the
said Prior recognised the advowson to be the right of Matilda,
and for himself and his successors surrendered it to the said
Matilda and her heirs for ever, an unusual act of grace, as it
was rarely that any property passing into the possession of a
religious house left their grasp again, until the time came when
they had finally and for ever to disgorge their acquisitions, not
seldom questionably obtained.&nbsp; On 12 May, 1240, in a dispute
between Robert, son of Osbert, and Matilda de Marton, concerning
land in Oxecumbe, Matilda admitted the said land to be the right
of Robert, &ldquo;to have and to hold to him and his heirs for
ever, he rendering 4<i>s.</i> by the year, and doing foreign
service.&rdquo;&nbsp; Truly, it would seem, from these various
disputes all occurring within less than the first half of the
13th century, <a name="citation147"></a><a href="#footnote147"
class="citation">[147]</a> there must have been something in the
atmosphere of Oxcombe which rendered its people peculiarly
litigious.&nbsp; Could the confined position, we are almost
inclined to ask, have narrowed their ideas, and, shut out as they
were from the larger world beyond, the &ldquo;combe,&rdquo; have
given them an undue sense of their own importance?</p>
<p>A gap now occurs of many years before we find further records
of this little lordship.</p>
<p>Among the Chancery Inquisitions in the reign of Richard III.
and Henry VII., is one (No. 246), held at Lincoln Castle, 28
January, 1504&ndash;5, by which it appears that Thomas Welby, a
member of another prominent Lincolnshire family, who held the
manor of Halstede, in Stixwould, in this neighbourhood, and
manors or lands in nearly 30 other parishes in various parts of
the county, had lands in Oxcomb, and the adjoining
Ruckland.&nbsp; He, by <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>charter, granted these possessions
to Edward Burgh, knight, George Taylbois, knight, and others, to
administer his will, on behalf of his son and heir, Thomas Welby,
then of the age of 16.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Architect. Soc.
Journal,&rdquo; 1895, p. 68.)</p>
<p>After the dissolution of the monasteries, in the following
reign, the lands connected with the priories of Sempringham and
Bullington, in Oxcombe, would pass into other hands, and
accordingly we find new names among the owners.&nbsp; By will,
dated 14 June, 1535, John Gedney, of Bag Enderby, Esquire, leaves
lands in Bag Enderby, Oxcombe, Winceby, Langton, and Somersby, to
his sons John and Andrew, a witness to the will being George
Musgrave, parson of Oxcombe.&nbsp; Oxcombe evidently fell to the
share of the latter of these two sons, since a few years later,
Andrew Gedney of Bag Enderby <a name="citation148"></a><a
href="#footnote148" class="citation">[148]</a> (in 1562)
presented Robert Brown to the benefice of Oxcombe, vacated by the
death of Roger Barry, (&ldquo;Architect. S. Journal,&rdquo; 1897,
p. 8.)</p>
<p>The tenure of the Gedneys, however, in due course went
&ldquo;the way of all flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had apparently
inherited considerable property from the old family of the
Crevec&oelig;urs, already mentioned.&nbsp; They had made good
connections, this Andrew himself having married Dorothy, daughter
of Sir William Skipwith, of South Ormsby, but they probably got
into difficulties at the time of &ldquo;the Lincolnshire
Rising&rdquo; in 1536, in which Andrew was involved.&nbsp; In
1579, Andrew Gedney sold Oxcombe Grange to John Copledyke, who
obtained Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s pardon for making the purchase
without her license, which was then required by law, as a royal
prerogative and source of revenue; and the following is the next
notice we find of the family:&mdash;By will, dated 1 April, 1613,
Richard Gedney, of Bag Enderby, Esq., leaves 10<i>s</i>. to the
poor of Oxcombe; but William Morton, of Oxcombe, and Thomas
Cheales of Hagworthingham, are requested to manage his manor of
Oxcombe, and pay his debts out of it.&nbsp; This was the
beginning of the end, and the Gedneys in due course disappeared
from the landed gentry of Lincolnshire.&nbsp; The name, for a
time, revived in the second half of the 19th century, in the
person of a relative of the present writer, who owned Candlesby
Hall, but it was only &ldquo;a flash in the pan,&rdquo; and they
are gone.</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>Another name now comes to the fore.&nbsp; Henry VIII.
granted extensive lands, which had been connected with the rich
monasteries, to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, who was
grandson of William Brandon, standard bearer to Henry VII., who
was slain at the battle of Bosworth.&nbsp; The Duke died leaving
two sons by his 4th wife, Catherine, who was daughter and heiress
of the Lord Willoughby d&rsquo; Eresby of that day.&nbsp;
(Dugdale &ldquo;Baronage,&rdquo; ii., 300.)&nbsp; These both died
of &ldquo;the sweating sickness,&rdquo; while quite young, and
thereupon the descendants of Sir William Brandon&rsquo;s
daughters were declared to be the heirs.&nbsp; One of these,
Eleanor, married John Glemham, of Glemham Parva, Co.
Suffolk.&nbsp; Their descendants, by marriage, or otherwise,
acquired the manors of Burwell, Calceby and Mareham-le-Fen, and
at later periods, lands in Goulceby, Donnington-on-Bain,
Belchford, Walmsgate, Fairforth, and several other parishes, and
in 1641, Sir Thomas Glemham sold most of these to Matthew Lister,
Esq., of St. Martins-in-the Fields, Co. Middlesex; among the
lands then disposed of, Oxcombe is named with the above
neighbouring parishes, though we do not find it specified
before.&nbsp; It is supposed that Sir Thomas, who was a warm
supporter of the unfortunate King Charles I., effected this sale
in order to aid his sovereign.&nbsp; Be that as it may, Oxcombe
passed from the Glemhams to the Listers.&nbsp; For nearly 200
years this family continued to hold the bulk of this property,
but, in their turn, the Listers also fell upon evil times, and
their estates gradually came under the hammer.&nbsp; The
patronage of the benefice was vested in the Langtons, of
Langton-by-Spilsby, in 1677, 1717, and 1762 (Liber Regis), and,
according to Noble&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gazetteer,&rdquo; also as late
as 1833, and they were probably owners in part, of the
soil.&nbsp; In 1799, John Grant died lord of the manor, and three
members of his family held it in succession.&nbsp; In 1842, the
benefice was held jointly with that of Belchford, by the Rev.
Egremont Richardson, B. Grant, Esq., being patron.&nbsp; Since
then it has been held singly by three successive incumbents, the
Rev. John Chalmers, the Rev. Goulding Saunders, and the Rev.
James Clarke, but since 1898 the two have been again held
together by the Rev. R. H. Domenichetti.&nbsp; In 1863, David
Briggs, Esq., was lord of the manor.&nbsp; On his death, in 1876,
it was bought by T. Ross, Esq., who died in 1885, when it was
again sold to the late Spedding Whitworth, Esq., of <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>Wath-upon-Dearne, Co. Yorke, whose son, Harrie
Whitworth, is the present owner.&nbsp; The whole parish is now
occupied and farmed by Mr. Henry Meanwell, who resides in the
manor house, a substantial residence, built in Elizabethan style,
in 1845&ndash;6, surrounded by extensive grounds, well-kept, and
a well-wooded park of some 50 acres.</p>
<p>The Church, dedicated to All Saints, is a small brick
structure, adjoining, to the east, the manor house grounds.&nbsp;
It was restored in 1884, by T. Ross, Esq., the then owner of the
manor, in the decorated style.&nbsp; It consists of nave, and
chancel, with apsidal east end.&nbsp; Over the west door rises an
octagonal turret of stone, containing one small bell.&nbsp; The
pulpit and sittings are of good old oak, with nicely carved poppy
heads.&nbsp; Near the pulpit is an old-fashioned square family
pew.&nbsp; The north and south walls of the nave have each a
couple of two-light trefoiled windows.&nbsp; The font is
octagonal, the faces trefoiled, with plain shields in each face,
the shaft octagonal, standing on a pediment of two steps.&nbsp;
The chancel arch is peculiar as being remarkably low.&nbsp; There
are good carved oak altar rails, and a modern east window of
three lights.&nbsp; On the south wall of the chancel is a tablet
in memory of John Grant, the former lord of the manor, who died
in 1799.&nbsp; The inscription formerly stated that he had made
&ldquo;&pound;100,000 by farming, which had never been done
before,&rdquo; but this latter part is now erased.&nbsp; On the
north wall is a tablet to Thomas Grant, who died in 1810; also to
William Grant, who died in 1817.&nbsp; In the churchyard is a
Grant altar tomb and vault; also two tombs of grey granite, in
memory of Thomas Ross, and his wife Anne; also a tomb of David
Briggs, Esq., former owner of the manor, who died, April 1st,
1876, and two others of Benjamin Briggs, and another David
Briggs.</p>
<p>This sequestered place is approached by a road, worn, probably
by usage through long ages, to a depth of several feet below the
ordinary level of the ground, the high banks on each side of it
being covered with neatly-trimmed shrubbery, and the whole has
the appearance of a well-cared-for estate, all the buildings
being substantial and in excellent order.&nbsp; Some of the
fields still retain names which tell of by-gone ages.&nbsp; To
the north are fields named &ldquo;Scotland Deepdales,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Scotland Walk,&rdquo; which may possibly refer to the old
parochial taxation, &ldquo;Scot and <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>Lot&rdquo; (Saxon, sceat and lot),
which was levied upon all subjects according to their ability,
for the poor, church expenses, village watchman, &amp;c., the
right of voting for members of parliament and other officials,
being vested in those who paid &ldquo;scot and lot.&rdquo;&nbsp;
One field is named &ldquo;Mill Walk,&rdquo; indicating where the
manorial lord once had that valuable source of revenue, the mill,
at which all the bordars and villeins were bound to have their
corn ground.&nbsp; One part of the ground is named
&ldquo;Groves&rsquo; Walk,&rdquo; a plantation so-called from a
poacher, Groves, who was shot in a night skirmish many years
ago.&nbsp; In a wood in the Farford direction, adders are said to
have been numerous.&nbsp; There is an extensive pasture named the
&ldquo;Intake,&rdquo; probably recording its first inclosure from
the common land.&nbsp; Two arable fields are called the
&ldquo;Near&rdquo; and &ldquo;Far&rdquo; &ldquo;Gaire&rdquo;;
gaire, garing, or geira, being a very ancient term for a section
of land ploughed in a different direction from the rest, as these
are still at the present time.&nbsp; While ploughing a part of
this manor in the year 1818, a labourer found a small silver
casket, containing 46<i>s.</i> of the early part of the reign of
Queen Elizabeth, which were scarcely injured by the lapse of
time.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Hist. Linc.,&rdquo; by J. Saunders, vol. ii.,
p. 177.)</p>
<p>Altogether, this parish of some 5 houses, and less than 40
inhabitants, forms a very interesting little estate.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Raithby</span>.</h3>
<p>Raithby is situated about 2 miles from Spilsby and about 9
miles from Horncastle, on the main road between the two towns,
<i>via</i> Hagworthingham.&nbsp; It is within the ancient soke of
Bolingbroke, and an appanage of the Duchy of Lancaster.&nbsp;
There is a post and money order office, and letters, <i>via</i>
Spilsby, arrive at 7.5 a.m., and depart at 5.40 p.m.&nbsp; The
nearest telegraph office is at Spilsby.&nbsp; Not much of the
early history of this parish is to be found.&nbsp; As is stated
in the notes on Mavis Enderby, these two parishes were closely
connected, land in both being held by the Saxon, Elnod (Domesday
Book), also, in early Norman times, by William de Karilepho, the
powerful Bishop of Durham, and by the Conqueror&rsquo;s
favourite, Ivo Taillebois, who, from the vast possessions which
he <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>acquired through his wife, the Lady Lucia, seems to
have verily suffered from the disease of &ldquo;land
hunger.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rather later, Eudo, son of Spirewic, the
founder of the Tattershall family, held lands in Raithby, as well
as at Mavis Enderby.&nbsp; In the reign of Edwd. I. (1402), the
manor and advowsons of Raithby and Mavis Enderby were held by
Robert de Willoughby, ancestor of the present Lord
Willoughby.&nbsp; The descendants of Ivo Taillebois seem to have
retained at least some of their property in Raithby for a longer
period than they did in some other parishes, as we find that
&ldquo;Thomas Tailbus&rdquo; of Raithby, by will, dated 7 March,
1556, requested that he might be buried &ldquo;in our
Lady&rsquo;s Choir.&rdquo;&nbsp; He states that he made his will
while &ldquo;mighty of mind, whole of witt and
understanding.&rdquo;&nbsp; He makes his wife, Johan, executrix,
and desires her to give to their son Roger, and Agnes Harper
(presumably a married daughter), &ldquo;as much as may be
conveniently spared.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Lincolnshire
Wills,&rdquo; by Canon Maddison).</p>
<p>The pedigree of the Taylbois&rsquo; of Raithby is given in the
Visitation of 1562.</p>
<p>Again, by will, dated 5 March, 1579, John Taylboys, of
Raithby, gent., desires that he may be buried in the
church.&nbsp; He leaves everything to his wife, except
10<i>s.</i> to his mother, and William Thompson and &ldquo;Wil
Cockson,&rdquo; executors are to pay &pound;12, &ldquo;bequeathed
by my father to sexe children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Littleburies had also land in Raithby; since by will,
dated 1 Sep., 1568, Humphrey Littlebury, of East Kirkby, left
land at Raithby, and other places, to his son, John Littlebury,
and John Littlebury of Hagworthingham, by will, dated 28 Sep.,
1612, left his lands at Raithby to his son John.&nbsp; As I
mention in the notes on Salmonby, the Littlebury family were
originally located in the Holbeach neighbourhood; Robert and his
ancestors held land there, and at Whaplode, of the abbots of
Croyland long before the reign of Edw. III.&nbsp; But he began to
get in arrear with his rent, as shewn by the following list of
omissions recorded against him:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>This
was a large sum in those days.&nbsp; But John Littlebury gave the
abbot &ldquo;diverse jewels&rdquo; in payment of this debt.&nbsp;
(Appendix to Cough&rsquo;s &ldquo;Croyland,&rdquo; from the Abbey
register.)</p>
<p>Sir Martin Littlebury was Chief Justice of England, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1243.&nbsp; His wife was Anne,
daughter of Sir Henry Rochford.&nbsp; They intermarried with
several other families of position and influence.&nbsp; Their
pedigree is given in the Herald&rsquo;s Visitation of
Lincolnshire, in 1562&ndash;64, coming down to Humphrey
Littlebury, of Stainsby, named above, as holding land in
Raithby.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Notices on Holbeach,&rdquo; by G. W.
McDonald).</p>
<p>By will, dated 4 March, 1599, Anne Skipwith, of Hanney, left
legacies to Thomas and Robert Raithby, and this patronymic is not
uncommon in the neighbourhood still.</p>
<p>In later years the manor of Raithby was the property of the
Brackenburies, who had a handsome residence, Raithby Hall, which
was, in 1848, purchased by the Rev. E. Rawnsley, who is now lord
of the manor.&nbsp; A curious circumstance connected with the
Hall is that during the time when it was owned by Mr. Robert Carr
Brackenbury, he, being a friend of John Wesley, granted him the
use of the hay loft for religious services, and subsequently by
will provided that all future owners of the property should
fulfil this condition, and these services are still occasionally
held there, so that we have now the anomaly of the Hall being
owned and occupied by a clergyman of the church of England, while
the loft over his stables is used by a Wesleyan minister.</p>
<p>The benefice formerly paid a pension to the abbots of Croyland
of &pound;1 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>&nbsp; At the Reformation the
tithes were seized by &ldquo;the Merry Monarch,&rdquo; and the
patronage of the benefice now belongs to the crown.&nbsp; The
late Geo. Walker, Esq., of Offord House, Spilsby, owned an estate
in this parish, also Admiral Buckle, who now resides at Gunby
Hall.&nbsp; There is a free school here for the poor children of
Raithby, Mavis Enderby, Hundleby, and Sausthorpe, founded and
endowed by Thomas Lawford, in 1683, and besides his endowment,
the teacher has the dividend of &pound;204 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
left by Elizabeth Kirkbridge, of Hull, in 1813, and the interest
of &pound;100 left by John Dawson, in 1839.</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>The
Church is dedicated to the Holy Trinity.&nbsp; It consists of
tower, nave, with south porch, north and south aisles, and
chancel.&nbsp; The tower is of 3 tiers, and has 3 bells.&nbsp;
The church was thoroughly restored in 1873, the chancel and nave
wholly rebuilt, the architect being Mr. G. G. Scott.&nbsp; The
porch has a very curious stoup in the western corner, with 3
Norman columns as supports.&nbsp; The north and south aisles have
3 bays, the columns being transitional Norman.&nbsp; In the north
wall is a door and two square-headed, perpendicular windows with
coloured glass; one of these has for its subjects St. George and
St. Andrew, the other, St. David and St. Patrick.&nbsp; There is
also a two-light window in the east wall of the north
aisle.&nbsp; In the south wall, west of the porch, is a coloured
two-light window, the subjects being, above, the Good Shepherd
and the Presentation in the Temple, and below, Christ blessing
little children, and our Lord&rsquo;s baptism.&nbsp; Next to the
porch, eastward, is a memorial two-light window to John Coleridge
Kennard, the subjects being, the Resurrection, and the
Ascension.&nbsp; The window at the east end of the south aisle is
a two-light one, with coloured glass, by Kemp, the subjects
being, Works of Mercy; it was put in in memory of Mrs. Rawnsley,
by friends.&nbsp; The font is modern, also the lectern and the
rood screen, which is coloured red, gilt, and blue.&nbsp; The
east, north, and south windows in the chancel were given by the
late Mrs. Rawnsley, who lengthened the chancel to its original
dimensions, and gave the screen.&nbsp; The east window has three
lights, the subjects being, in the centre, the Crucifixion, in
the northern light, Gethsemane, in the southern light, the
Saviour&rsquo;s baptism.&nbsp; The walls of the chancel are
painted with various devices.&nbsp; The reredos has three
compartments, the centre, showing the Crucifixion; on the right
(south), the Saviour and the Magdalen, Noli me tangere; on the
left (north), the angel appearing to Mary, Ave Maria.&nbsp; Two
other windows have the following subjects:&mdash;In one, in the
centre, is the Lord in glory, with St. Michael, on the one side,
St. Gabriel, on the other, by Milner; in the other, of four
lights, put in by members of the Rawnsley family, in memory of
their mother, the subjects are, in the lower part, one scene
throughout, the birth at Bethlehem; above, the compartments show
the Annunciation, with the Presentation and Visitation on either
side.&nbsp; The south chancel window of three lights, <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>with
coloured glass, has the three subjects, St. Alban, St. Agnes, and
St. Catherine.&nbsp; There is a piscina in the south wall of the
chancel.&nbsp; The material of the structure is Spilsby green
sandstone.&nbsp; The tower is of the Perpendicular period, other
parts being a mixture of the Perpendicular, Decorated, and
Transitional styles.&nbsp; The church is unusually rich in
coloured glass, although all of it modern.&nbsp; The benefice, a
rectory, is held by the Rev. George Ward, who lives at Mavis
Enderby, of which parish he is also rector.&nbsp; Of the church
plate, the chalice is of the date of Cromwell; the paten and
former cover of chalice are of the date of Elizabeth.&nbsp; A
modern paten has been presented by the Rev. E. Rawnsley.&nbsp;
The register dates from 1558.&nbsp; It contains a note by a
former rector, stating that a number of pages had been lost in
the waste paper basket of his predecessor, but that, from other
sources, he had himself supplied the deficiency.&nbsp; Then
follows a long series of entries, all in one handwriting, the
curious part, however, is that his own death is recorded in the
same handwriting.&nbsp; We leave it to the reader to solve this
puzzle of a posthumous record.&nbsp; The sandstone, which
prevails generally throughout this district, disappears at
Raithby, but about half-a-mile north-east of Raithby church,
numerous phosphatic nodules are found scattered about the
surface.&nbsp; The nodule bed can be traced across the fields to
the south-west, and the phosphates lie generally in
patches.&nbsp; The hill, south of Raithby, consists of the
formation known as Tealby clay, capped with chalky boulder clay,
blue clay appearing on its western slope.&nbsp; These clays rest
upon a floor of hard calcareous ferruginous rock, full of brown
oolitic grains.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Ranby</span>.</h3>
<p>Ranby is situated on the old Roman road to Caistor, northward,
rather more than 7 miles from Horncastle.&nbsp; The vicar, the
Rev. G. S. Lee, resides at Benniworth, rather more than 3 miles
distant, of which he is rector.&nbsp; Letters, <i>via</i>
Lincoln, arrive at 10.30.&nbsp; Ranby is probably a contraction
of Ravenby; as we have near Louth, two parishes, Ravendale, east
and west, and the hamlet of <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>Raventhorpe, in the north of the
county, in the parish of Appleby, near Brigg.&nbsp; Ravendale is
contracted into the patronymic Randell; and so Ravenby becomes
Ranby.</p>
<p>Ranby Hall, the seat of the Otter family, who have been
located here and at Clayworth, Notts., more than a century, is a
handsome residence in well-wooded grounds.&nbsp; One of the
family was Bishop of Chichester, and another Archdeacon of
Chichester.</p>
<p>In Domesday Book, the manor of Ranby is reckoned among the
possessions of Odo, Bishop of Baieux, who was half-brother of
William the Conqueror, and Earl of Kent.&nbsp; He became Bishop
in 1049, and died at Palermo, on his way to the Holy Land, in
1097.&nbsp; Besides being Earl of Kent, he was Count Palatine and
Justiciary of England.&nbsp; His abilities and his influence were
so great that writers of the day described him as being,
&ldquo;totius Angli&aelig;, Vice-dominus sub rege.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was, however, too arrogant, and aspiring to the Papacy, he was
about to leave England for Rome, taking with him the wealth he
had amassed, when he was apprehended by King William, and sent to
prison in Normandy.&nbsp; On the death of the Conqueror, he was
liberated by William Rufus, but never acquired his former power,
and being concerned in a conspiracy, had to abjure the
realm.&nbsp; He held at one time 76 lordships in Lincolnshire,
besides many in other counties.&nbsp; Another Norman, Ralph de
St. Valery, a town in Picardy, also had a grant of land in Ranby,
to the extent of 360 acres with 14 socmen holding 7 oxgangs, and
2 bordars with 240 acres between them.&nbsp; A Saxon thane,
Godric, had some 604 acres.&nbsp; The church had a resident
priest, owning a mill, worth 10<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a year, and
270 acres of meadow.&nbsp; At a later date, Ranby was an appanage
of Tupholme Abbey. <a name="citation156a"></a><a
href="#footnote156a" class="citation">[156a]</a></p>
<p>The Church, dedicated to St. German, stands on an elevation,
and would be a conspicuous object for several miles, but that it
is embowered in lofty trees. <a name="citation156b"></a><a
href="#footnote156b" class="citation">[156b]</a>&nbsp; It was
restored in 1839 at the expense of Miss Alice Otter, who also
presented three bells; and it was further improved in 1862, when
the tower was incased with new stone, and <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>the chancel
re-built.&nbsp; The old chancel arch was at that time removed,
and now forms the arch under the tower, the stone having been
re-chiselled.&nbsp; The tower is massive, with four pinnacles,
having two-light flamboyant windows in each face, and small
lancet windows below them, in the west and south sides.&nbsp; In
the north wall of the nave, there is one two-light flamboyant
window, and in the south wall, two similar ones.&nbsp; A small
north transept forms a vestry, in the west wall of which are
preserved some small arches from an earlier fabric, and in its
north wall is a two-light flamboyant window.&nbsp; In the north
chancel wall there is a small one-light window.&nbsp; The east
window has three lights with three trefoils above, and in the
south chancel wall there is a two-light window with trefoil
above.&nbsp; All the chancel windows have coloured glass.&nbsp;
The south window is a memorial of Francis Otter, of
Clayworth.&nbsp; The subject of the east window is the
Ascension.&nbsp; The pillars of the new chancel arch have
richly-carved capitals.&nbsp; The sittings are of plain
oak.&nbsp; The font is octagonal, with plain shields and other
devices on the faces.&nbsp; There is a Walesby tablet on the
south wall of the nave, and large Walesby monuments in the
churchyard.&nbsp; Weir, in his &ldquo;History of
Lincolnshire,&rdquo; mentions a large ancient tumulus as being
near the church. <a name="citation157a"></a><a
href="#footnote157a" class="citation">[157a]</a></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Revesby</span>.</h3>
<p>Revesby is situated about 7&frac12; miles from Horncastle, in
a south-easterly direction; some 12 miles north-west from Boston,
8 miles south-west from Spilsby, and about 7 miles East, from the
nearest railway station at Tattershall.&nbsp; Letters, <i>via</i>
Boston, arrive at 7 a.m.&nbsp; The nearest telegraph office is at
Mareham-le-Fen.&nbsp; One derivation of the name Revesby is from
a Danish word meaning a &ldquo;fox,&rdquo; the Danes certainly at
one time settled extensively in this neighbourhood, and
&ldquo;by&rdquo; is a very common Danish termination.&nbsp;
(Streatfeild &ldquo;Lincolnshire and the Danes.&rdquo;)&nbsp;
Another and perhaps more likely derivation is from the
&ldquo;reeve,&rdquo; or public guardian of the fen, <a
name="citation157b"></a><a href="#footnote157b"
class="citation">[157b]</a> who might well <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>reside
here, to look after the means of communication, roads and
channels in the great tract of country southward, which was at
one time almost a waste of morass, and subject to frequent
inundation from the sea, and in connection with this, it may be
mentioned that one of the recognised duties of religious houses,
<a name="citation158a"></a><a href="#footnote158a"
class="citation">[158a]</a> such as the Abbey of Revesby, was to
keep roads and bridges in proper repair, and a portion of the
Revesby property, named Stickney Wydale, was granted to the
abbey, on condition that the monks kept in proper order the
&ldquo;Northdyke Causeway,&rdquo; then a main road raised above
the floods. <a name="citation158b"></a><a href="#footnote158b"
class="citation">[158b]</a>&nbsp; And among the charters and
deeds of Revesby, is one (No. 7<i>b</i>), by which William de
Romara undertakes to compel the men of Holland to keep in repair
a waggon-road from Sibsey. <a name="citation158c"></a><a
href="#footnote158c" class="citation">[158c]</a></p>
<p>The history of Revesby at that period is lost to us.&nbsp; No
Saxon chronicles exist, as they do as regards some other places,
to tell us of those early days.&nbsp; Yet we can, in a degree,
connect Revesby with a great Saxon family, and one which is
represented by a leading family in our county in the present
day.</p>
<p>The Abbey of Revesby was founded by William de Romara, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1143. <a name="citation158d"></a><a
href="#footnote158d" class="citation">[158d]</a>&nbsp; He was the
son of Roger de Romara, who married (about 1093), as her 2nd
husband, the lady Lucia, who was daughter and heiress of Thorold,
of Buchenale (now Bucknall in this neighbourhood), Sheriff of
Lincolnshire, and that family survives now in Sir John C.
Thorold, of Syston Hall, near Grantham.&nbsp; The family of
Thorold, or, as it was spelt at that time, Turold, was even then
old and distinguished.&nbsp; He was the brother of the Lady
Godiva, of Coventry fame, wife of Earl Leofric, and mother of
Earl Algar, and descended, according to Camden
(&ldquo;Britannia&rdquo;, p. 474), and others, <a
name="citation158e"></a><a href="#footnote158e"
class="citation">[158e]</a> from the Saxon Earl, Egga (and
Morcar), who flourished in the 8th century.&nbsp; The first
husband of Lucia, was Ivo <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Taillebois, of Anjou, who came over
with the Conqueror, as the leader of his Angevin
auxiliaries.&nbsp; After the death of the brave young Saxon
nobles, Edwin and Morcar, brothers-in-law, of King Harold, who
refused to submit to the Norman yoke, their sister, the Lady
Lucia, became entitled to all their possessions, and therefore
was an heiress worth securing; and, much against her wish, the
Conqueror bestowed her upon his favourite, Ivo (<span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1072).&nbsp; With her, this Ivo
acquired, among much other property, the manors of Revesby and
East Kirkby.&nbsp; We find the first mention of Revesby, in
Domesday Book (<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1085), as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;In Churchebi and Resuesbi there are 12
carucates (or about 1440 acres) of land, rateable to gelt;&rdquo;

class="citation">[159]</a> the land is 12 carucates; 54 sokemen
and 14 villeins have these 12 carucates.&nbsp; Ivo has 1 carucate
(in demense) and 2 churches, and 180 acres of meadow land.&nbsp;
The whole manor, with all that belongs thereto, is 6 miles long
and 6 miles broad.&nbsp; Turold was Lord of Spalding, and his
daughter Lucia, and conjointly her husband, Ivo, founded the
Priory of Spalding.&nbsp; But Ivo, by his acquisitions, became so
great a tyrant, to all connected with him, that he was eventually
outlawed by King Rufus, and banished the kingdom.&nbsp; He fled
to Anjou.&nbsp; After a time he was allowed to return to his
wife, the Lady Lucia, who was holding her court at Spalding; but,
to her great relief, he shortly afterwards died of paralysis,
and, writes the chronicler, Peter de Blois, &ldquo;hardly had one
month elapsed after his death, when she married that illustrious
young man, Roger de Romara, and lost all recollection of Ivo
Taillebois.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their son, William, was created first
Earl of Lincoln, and, following the example of his mother at
Spalding, he gave certain lands to the monks of Riveaux, Co.
York, to found a Cistercian Abbey, the lands aforesaid being all
Revesby, Thoresby and Sithesby, and, as certain portions of
Revesby were held by another lord, he effected an exchange, by
giving land commensurate in Miningsby, and by a similar process
of exchange, secured other further portions, so as to bring the
abbey estates into what would now be termed &ldquo;a ring
fence.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have not space to go to any extent into
the history of the abbey.&nbsp; The original charter describes
the property as &ldquo;totam terram de Revesbi&acirc;, et
Thoresbi&acirc;, et Schichthesbi&acirc;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of the two
<a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>churches, one, that of Thoresby, was at the time held
by a priest named Ivo, in exchange for which the Earl William,
gave him the church of East Kirkby, and appurtenances.&nbsp; This
church probably stood on a site of the present church of St.
Lawrence, at Revesby.&nbsp; (Howlett&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Lincolnshire,&rdquo; Allan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hist.
Linc.&rdquo;)&nbsp; The other church, of St. Sythe, was doubtless
in the southern part of the present park, which has retained the
name of Sithesby, or St. Scythe&rsquo;s until recent times.&nbsp;
The abbey itself was to the south-east of the present church, at
some quarter-of-a-mile distance, and of considerable dimensions,
covering some acres of ground.&nbsp; From a lecture, given by the
late Right Honble. Edward Stanhope, we gather that the abbey
church, built of Ancaster stone, was at least 240ft. long, and
over 60ft. wide, with many graceful pillars supporting its
roof.&nbsp; The choir was of unusual form, extending some
distance down the nave.&nbsp; Beyond it, discovered in making
excavations in 1869, 70, was the tomb of the founder, having this
inscription: <span class="GutSmall">HIC JACET IN TUMBA
WIELLIELMUS DE ROMARE</span>, <span class="GutSmall">COMES
LINCOLNI&AElig;</span>, <span class="GutSmall">FUNDATOR ISTIUS
MONASTERII SANCTI LAURENTII DE REIVISBYE</span>. <a
name="citation160"></a><a href="#footnote160"
class="citation">[160]</a>&nbsp; Near this were tombstones
inscribed to William de Romara, son of William, Earl of Lincoln,
who died before his father, and of William de Romara, son of
Lucia, Countess of Lincoln.&nbsp; Three bodies were discovered
and re-buried a short distance from this spot, being doubtless
those of the founder and his two sons.&nbsp; In his later years,
William de Romara himself became a monk, and requested to be
buried &ldquo;before the high aulter;&rdquo; and the site is now
marked by a granite stone, placed here in 1890, by the late Right
Honourable Edward Stanhope.&nbsp; The Abbey field, approached by
a broad causeway, on the north side, more than 250 yards long,
has traces of four mounds, at different points, probably for
outlook and defence.&nbsp; One <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>of these, stands in an enclosure to
the west, called Saffron Garth, doubtless the favourite resort of
the monks, who were skilled gardeners; an enclosure on the other,
north side, of the road, opposite this &ldquo;garth,&rdquo; is
called &ldquo;Paradise,&rdquo; supposed to have been the
orchard.&nbsp; Fish ponds, to supply the monks with their ascetic
diet, are to be traced in various parts around.&nbsp; At Medlam,
to the south-east, are the remains of a chapel or oratory.&nbsp;
The abbot&rsquo;s private residence stood in the present park,
and some of the outbuildings of his establishment remained until
recent years, near the later mansion of the proprietors of
Revesby.</p>
<p>We will now give a few peculiar extracts from some of the
deeds connected with the abbey.&nbsp; Most of these, until late
years, were in the possession of the Marquis of Exeter, at
Burghley House, Stamford, whose ancestors, as will be shewn
hereafter, once held the property, and in 1881 they were
presented to the Right Honble. E. Stanhope, by his lordship.</p>
<p>In celebration of the foundation of the Abbey, William de
Romara &ldquo;manumitted,&rdquo; or released from serfdom, any of
his villeins and dependants who would accept their freedom,
&ldquo;to go where they chose, and, if they remained on the
estate, to give them land instead.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among those who
accepted freedom, were William Medicus, or the Doctor, and Roger
Barkarius, a name still known in the neighbourhood. <a
name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"
class="citation">[161]</a>&nbsp; The witnesses to the deed of
liberty were Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, William Archdeacon,
William Chancellor, and others.</p>
<p>By deed No. 8, William gives land in Stickney, and services
due to him, from Alan of Stickney and his successors, to which
Alan agrees; the money to be spent on wine for the
&ldquo;Masses&rdquo; of the Abbey services.</p>
<p>To one deed (No. 20), for conveyance of pasturage for 20
cattle, 20 pigs, and 100 sheep, the witness is Thorold, Dean of
Horncastle, a scion, doubtless, of the family of the Lady
Lucia.&nbsp; He is further designated as &ldquo;Magister
Willelmus Novi Operis,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> of Newark.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>By
deed 24, Matilda daughter of Roger de Huditoft (Huttoft) widow of
William of Stickney gives half a bovate of land in Stickney
&ldquo;in the time of my widowhood&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, when the
property became at her own disposal.&nbsp; The witnesses are two
women, Christiana, wife of Henry de Claxby, and Eda, wife of
Richard, priest of Mareham; not, therefore, a celibate.</p>
<p>By deed 27, Alan Smerehorn of Kirkby (East) gives a sedes
molendini, <i>i.e.</i> a water mill and premises, with right to
draw water through his land from Bolingbroke and Kirkby.</p>
<p>By deed 30, Hamelinus de Jherdeburcg (Jerburg) gives land in
Stickney, &ldquo;quam tenui de hospitalibus de Jerusalem in
terretorio de Stickenei&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> which he had held of
the monks of the Hospice of Jerusalem in Stickney, there having
been a minor religious house there; of which Robert Picha is
named as Preceptor in another Deed (25), temp. Henry II.</p>
<p>By a charter of Richard I. (Dugdale V. 456) the abbots are
confirmed in the possession of lands in Toynton, the grange of
Toft (still existing) Fulsby, lands in Miningsby, Kirkby, Claxby,
Mareham, Tumby, Hameringham, Wood Enderby, Skegness, and many
other parishes.</p>
<p>By deed No. 41, William, son of Roger de Bikinghesbi gives
land in Miningsby for gate alms, <i>i.e.</i> to relieve beggars
at the Abbey-gate, the monks being the great, and almost only,
friends of the suffering and needy.</p>
<p>By deed No. 50, Ranulph, Earl of Chester, gives to the Abbey
&ldquo;his servant Roger, son of Thoreword of Sibsey, with all
his property and chattells.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the man himself is
treated as part and parcel with the chattells.</p>
<p>By deed 69, Gaufrid of Kirkby gives certain lands &ldquo;ad
chorum ecclesi&aelig; aspergendum et decorandum,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> for washing and decorating the choir.</p>
<p>Deed 75 conveys to the Abbey another servant, Radulph, son of
Gamel the Palmer, with goods and chattells.&nbsp; The father here
mentioned had evidently made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Deed 78 gives to the Abbey &ldquo;the homage of Gaufrid Le
Neucume of Stickney and all his service.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here,
(temp. Henry III.) is one of the family of Newcome, or Newcomen,
who, centuries later, became connected by marriage with <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>the Banks
family, in the person of the grandfather of Sir Joseph Banks.</p>
<p>By No. 108, Hugo de Lindsey gives one selion of land to
maintain one candle burning before the altar of the blessed
Virgin in the Chapel of St. Lawrence, (temp. Henry III. or Ed.
I.)</p>
<p>By No. 115, William of Stickney gives land for the maintenance
of candles to be kept burning in the Abbey church, one before the
altar of the blessed Virgin, in honour of St. Margaret, and the
other at the altar of St. Nicholas, in honour of St. James the
Apostle.</p>
<p>By No. 141, the Abbot leases land in Wilksby (<span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1344) to John Hardegray, who is to
pay &ldquo;unum granum piperis&rdquo; (pepper corn rent),
annually at Christmas.</p>
<p>By No. 144, the Abbot and Convent grant to Richard Cave of
Stickney certain land on payment of 8 silver pence
annually.&nbsp; (2 Hen. V. Jan. 25, 1415.)</p>
<p>Then follows finally at the Dissolution, deed No. 150A, by
which John, Abbot of Revesby, and the convent, grant (Nolentes
Volentes) to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and his heirs, and
assigns, the office of chief steward of the manors, lands, etc.,
of the Abbey, with an annuity of &pound;26 3<i>s.</i>
8<i>d.</i>&nbsp; (Harleyan Charter, 44, Brit. Mus.)</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the end.&nbsp; The monks, who, with
all their faults, had preserved for us our Bibles, had been the
great patrons of learning, the friends of the poor, the teachers
of agriculture, who had maintained our bridges and our roads,
were forced to accept pittances smaller than those they had, on a
generous scale, dealt out to thousands of others.&nbsp; To
Charles, Duke of Suffolk, were granted the Abbey estates in
1539.&nbsp; He died in 1545, and was buried at Windsor.&nbsp; His
two sons both died in one day, July 16th, 1551, at the Bishop of
Lincoln&rsquo;s house at Buckden.&nbsp; The Dukedom descended to
the Marquis of Dorset, who had married the half-sister of
Charles.&nbsp; The estates were divided, in 1552, among the
descendants of Sir William Brandon.&nbsp; They were Sir Henry
Sidney, Knight; Thomas Glemham, Esq.; John Carsey, Esq.; and
Francis his son by Margaret his wife, sister to Charles Brandon;
Christian Darnell, widow; Walter Ayscoughe, Esq.; and Henry
Ayscoughe his son by Elizabeth his wife; and John Tyre,
gentleman, and Elizabeth his wife.</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>John
Carsey (also spelt Kersey) had the Revesby estate, Wilksby and
Wood Enderby, and resided at Revesby.&nbsp; His son Francis
probably resided at South Ormsby, and in 1575, the father and son
jointly sold the estate to Thomas Cecil, Lord Treasurer
Burleigh.&nbsp; The property then descended, through the 1st and
2nd Earls of Exeter, and Elizabeth, wife of Thomas Howard, Earl
of Berkshire, to Henry Howard.&nbsp; He dying without male issue,
was succeeded by his nephew, Craven Howard, in 1663.&nbsp; Craven
Howard built a mansion here.&nbsp; But the entire property was
sold in 1714 to the Banks family for &pound;14,000, by his
representatives the daughters of Henry Howard. <a
name="citation164"></a><a href="#footnote164"
class="citation">[164]</a>&nbsp; The last of the Banks family was
Sir Joseph Banks, well known for his enclosure of the Fens and
other works of public utility in the county, his patronage of
science in every form, and his voyages of discovery.&nbsp; He
died in 1820, and, by his will, most of the estates were
bequeathed to Col. the Honble. James Hamilton Stanhope, who
served in the Peninsular War, and at Waterloo, other portions
being left to Sir Henry Hawley and his heirs, &ldquo;with
remainder to Sir Edward Knatchbull&rdquo; (who managed the
estates for his widow, Lady Banks).&nbsp; (Weir&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Hist. Linc.&rdquo; vol. i., p. 414, Ed., 1828;
&ldquo;Saunders&rsquo; Hist.&rdquo; vol. ii., p. 113).&nbsp; He
held them for a very short period, and was succeeded by J. Banks
Stanhope, Esq., formerly M.P. for N. Lincolnshire (in 1823), who,
some years ago, surrendered the estates to his cousin and adopted
heir, the Right Honble. E. Stanhope, 2nd son of the 5th Earl
Stanhope; and late M.P. for Horncastle Division.</p>
<p>Mr. Banks Stanhope greatly improved, and, indeed, may be said
to have rebuilt the mansion of Revesby, from designs by the
architect Burns, which now stands in beautiful grounds, and an
extensive park, near the site of the former residence of the
abbots.&nbsp; Vast sums have also been spent by him on the
improvement of the estate; the rebuilding of farmhouses and
cottages, so as to make the village a model one in every
way.&nbsp; The Abbey, which is constructed throughout of Ancaster
stone, and in the style of James I., is the repository of objects
of art, of natural <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>history, and of antiquarian interest, collected by Sir
Joseph Banks, J. Banks Stanhope, Esq., and more recently by the
Right Honble. E. Stanhope, sufficient to form a museum.</p>
<p>A subject of interest which has not yet been noticed is two
tumuli, or barrows, in the parish, on the left hand, close to the
road, and not many yards south of the Red Lion Inn.&nbsp; They
were considered by the antiquarian Stukeley (&ldquo;Itin
Curios,&rdquo; p. 23) to have been the burial place of two
British kings, and probably also connected with the religious
services of the Druids.&nbsp; They stand in an enclosure, the
breadth of which, he says, &ldquo;is 100 Celtic feet, and the
length 300.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1780 the northernmost of these barrows&mdash;there were
formerly three&mdash;was explored by Sir Joseph Banks, but
nothing was found of any interest beyond indications that it had
been examined before, and since that time it has been
levelled.&nbsp; He thought, however, that it had been the site of
religious sacrifices.&nbsp; In August, 1892, explorations were
carried out under the eye of the late Right Honble. E.
Stanhope.&nbsp; Here again there were indications of former
examination, not however to any great depth, and when the centre
of the mound was reached a kind of sarcophagus, made of puddled
clay, was found, from 5ft. to 6ft. in length, lying north and
south, the sides 7in. or 8in. thick, and having an arch rising to
a height of 2&frac12;ft.; the bottom, slightly concave, rested on
the original soil, within this was black earth quite different in
colour to the rest, which was believed to be human remains.&nbsp;
No bones, however, were found.&nbsp; Broken pieces of pottery and
two old nails, were found outside this receptacle, which were
pronounced by Sir A. W. Franks, of the British Museum, to be
medi&aelig;val, and to have probably been introduced by previous
explorers.&nbsp; (Account by E.S., &ldquo;Linc. N. &amp;
Q.,&rdquo; vol. iii., pp. 145&ndash;7.)</p>
<p>We have little more to say of the past history of
Revesby.&nbsp; When the Spanish Armada was expected to invade our
shores in 1589, one of those Lincolnshire gentry who subscribed
&pound;25, a large sum in those days, towards the defence of the
country, was Nicholas Saunderson of Rearsby, or Revesby; he also,
at the muster at Horncastle in 1586, furnished &ldquo;1 light
horse&rdquo;; John May of Mareham doing the same
(&ldquo;Architect. S. Journal,&rdquo; 1894, p. 214.)</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Among
the old observances of Revesby was the annual fair, an occasion
of much jovial festivity, and in the days of Sir Joseph Banks,
that fine old English gentleman, the Sir Roger de Coverley of his
day, encouraged such old time customs, providing ale most
generously for all comers, and driving down to the village green,
where the booths were arranged, with his party in two or three
coaches.&nbsp; Morrice dancing and the mummers play always had
his patronage.&nbsp; In these days of &ldquo;<i>autres temps</i>,
<i>autres m&oelig;urs</i>,&rdquo; all these have gone out of
vogue.&nbsp; Whether the modern, <i>soi disant</i>, more refined
practices at village feasts are an improvement on the old is a
question we leave others to decide.</p>
<p>Revesby church, dedicated to St. Lawrence, was formerly a
small structure, rebuilt in 1735, partly with materials taken
from the former Abbey, by Joseph Banks, Esq. (great grandfather
of the Right Honble. Sir Joseph Banks), who purchased the
property from the Honble. Henry Howard, 3rd son of the Earl of
Berkshire, in 1714.&nbsp; The benefice then, as now, was a
chaplaincy to the owners of the Revesby Abbey estate. <a
name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166"
class="citation">[166]</a>&nbsp; That church contained among its
chief features a memorial tablet at the east end of the chancel
to Nehemiah Rawson, Esq., who died in 1657, a name still common
in the neighbourhood; another to the above-named Honble. Henry
Howard, who died in 1663; and on the north side of the chancel
was a large marble monument, surmounted by a bust, and an
inscription in Latin to Joseph Banks, Esq., who died 1727.&nbsp;
After renovation at various periods this old fabric was removed,
and, on the same site, the present handsome church, a fine
specimen of the 14th century, flamboyant style, was erected at
the joint expense of J. Banks Stanhope, Esq., and the late Right
Honourable Edward Stanhope, M.P., lord of the manor in
1890&ndash;2.&nbsp; The church consists of <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>western
tower, surmounted by a lofty spire; nave, with north aisle and
south porch; and chancel, with organ chamber and vestry on the
north side; the whole forming an elegant structure, reminding
one, though on a smaller scale, of the famous marble church of
Bodelwyddan in North Wales.&nbsp; It is built generally of
Ancaster stone, the walls inside being lined with red Hollington
sandstone.&nbsp; Mr. Hodgson Fowler was the architect, and in
several details of the building he reproduced features borrowed
from the original Abbey.</p>
<p>The following is a detailed description of the
church:&mdash;In the south wall of the interior of the tower, in
a recess, are various carved and other fragments of stone, and
near them the capitals and bases of some small Norman columns;
and on the north wall is a fragment of a canopied niche; all
these being carefully preserved remnants of the original Abbey
church.</p>
<p>In the centre is a small Norman font with plain bowl,
supported on a shaft of 8 clustered columns, resting on a square
base.&nbsp; In the tower above is a peal of 8 carillon bells of
good tone, embracing the octave.&nbsp; The north aisle has 4
lofty bays.&nbsp; In the north wall are four two-light windows
with trefoil and other tracery above.&nbsp; Against the west wall
of this aisle is a massive marble monument surmounted by a bust,
probably the old monument renewed, bearing in English the
inscription, &ldquo;In memory of Joseph Banks, M.P. for Grimsby
and Totnes, born 1681, died 1727, married Mary Hancock, and had
issue Joseph, and Mary, Lady Whichcote, died 1726&rdquo;; to the
left, &ldquo;Joseph Banks II., born 1695, died 1741, married,
1st, Annie Hodgkinson, and had issue, &amp;c.; Eleonora (the
youngest) born 1723, died 1793, married the Honble. Henry
Grenville, and was mother of Louisa, Countess Stanhope; married,
2ndly, Catherine widow of Newcomen Wallis.&rdquo;&nbsp; Right
inscription, &ldquo;William Banks, born 1719, died 1761, married
Sarah Bate, and left issue, (1) Joseph, afterwards Sir Joseph
Banks, (2) Sarah Sophia, born 1744, died 1818.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The south nave wall next to the porch eastward has two
two-light windows similar to those in the north wall, and next to
the chancel wall a large three-light window, flamboyant above, of
coloured glass&mdash;the subjects being St. James, St. Peter, and
St. John, bearing the inscription <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>below, &ldquo;Presented by the
tenants of the Revesby estate as a token of esteem for James
Banks Stanhope, Esquire, of Revesby Abbey, 1892.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
pulpit is of carved modern oak, being Flemish work, the subjects
scriptural, resting on a stone base; the sittings throughout are
of oak with carved panels at the ends.&nbsp; There is a good
brass lectern, and oak fald-stool.&nbsp; The choir stalls in the
chancel are of massive carved oak with good poppy heads.&nbsp;
The panels of the sedilia are from the Abbot&rsquo;s house; the
encaustic tiles are copies of the originals, the remains of which
are preserved in the bell chamber of the tower.&nbsp; The east
window is of five lights with rich flamboyant tracery
above.&nbsp; It is filled with coloured glass by Messrs. Heaton,
Butler and Bayne, and erected by public subscription in memory of
the late Right Honourable Edward Stanhope.&nbsp; The subjects are
two rows of figures; in the lower row, in the two lights on the
north side, are St. Edward and St. Matthew, then St. Boniface and
St. Wilfred; in the central compartment, three figures, St.
George, St. Martin, and St. Alban; then, to the south, St. Hugh
and St. Jerome, in one light, St. Thomas and St. Lawrence in the
other outside light.&nbsp; In the upper row, the central figure
is the Saviour, crowned, His right hand uplifted in blessing, His
left holding a sceptre; in the two compartments, on either side,
are angels with harps, viols, &amp;c.&nbsp; In the tracery above
are heads of angels, and above all, the Angus Dei.&nbsp; The
reredos is of plush velvet.&nbsp; A jewelled cross stands on the
super-altar.&nbsp; The communion table is covered with a rich
altar cloth of velvet and lace.&nbsp; To the north and south of
the table, the walls are panelled with oak, to the height of the
east window, with devices representing the ivy, olive, rose,
gourd, pomegranate, vine, and fig; the fruit being inlaid mother
of pearl, given by the Honble. Mrs. Stanhope.&nbsp; There is a
brass tablet in the north wall, giving an account of the east
window.&nbsp; In the south wall is a plain two-light trefoiled
window, and a long stone seat below.&nbsp; The organ has handsome
coloured pipes, and has in front a richly-carved oak
screen.&nbsp; At the main entrance to the churchyard is a lich
gate, &ldquo;erected by friends and tenants, in loving memory of
the Right Honourable Edward Stanhope.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
churchyard, beneath the east window, is the Stanhope grave,
framed in white marble, with a recumbent cross of the same
material <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>within it.&nbsp; Beneath that spotless emblem of our
faith, lies all that was mortal of a noble being, a man
&ldquo;sans peur et sans reproche,&rdquo; singularly gifted, of
varied tastes, wide sympathies, generous instincts, of
indefatigable industry as a statesman in the service of his Queen
and country, and we may add without presumption, a sincere
Christian, of strong convictions.&nbsp; Edward Stanhope, died, 22
December, 1893, admired by his opponents almost as much as he was
beloved by his friends, and of him, we may truly say that his
gain was our loss.&nbsp; Opposite the village green are
alms-houses, for five poor men and five poor women, founded by
Joseph Banks, Esq., in 1727, who endowed them with an annual rent
charge of &pound;50.&nbsp; Revesby is emphatically a model
village, the residences of the tenants and their labourers, being
alike maintained in the best order.</p>
<p>The parsonage, a good residence, erected by J. Banks Stanhope,
Esq., stands in pretty grounds and is now adorned, internally,
with much carved oak furniture, cabinets, overmantel, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., and with a display of numerous silver cups, trophies won
in various competitions, by the Rev. P. O. Ashby, the active and
energetic chaplain.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Salmonby</span>.</h3>
<p>Salmonby is distant from Horncastle about five miles, in an
easterly direction, on the road to Tetford, which it
adjoins.&nbsp; The register dates from 1558, and contains some
curious entries.&nbsp; One is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Helena
More, centesimo decimo &aelig;tatis anno, et undecimo die mensis
Junii, Anno Dom. 1638 fato succubuit, et die duo decimo dicti
mensis sepulta est 1638,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, Helena More
succumbed to her fate in the 110th year of her age, and on the
11th day of the month of June, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1638, and was buried on the 12th day of the said month, 1638.</p>
<p>In the month of March, 1723, there were six burials within
nine days, three members of the same family; no cause for the
mortality being mentioned.&nbsp; In the following year (1724),
there were ten burials, among them being four of the name of
Wait, three Ansels, and two Bartholomews.</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>The
rector from 1710 to 1741, Rev. Henry Marshall, was also rector of
Fulletby, and vicar of Orby, and he was succeeded by his son in
the rectory of Salmonby, who also held the benefice of Ashby
Puerorum.</p>
<p>There are some rather peculiar field names in this parish, two
Wongs, far and near, a relic of Saxon nomenclature; also
Skerrills and Skerrills Holt, Bramfleets, Haverlins (Haver=oats),
Dry-sykes, Rotten Fen, Wallow Farm, and Wallow Camp, and The
Mires, the last four, doubtless derived from the character of the
localities.&nbsp; From a part of this boggy land in the north of
the parish, rises a spring of chalibeate water, said to resemble
the properties of the Tunbridge Wells; a pulverulent blue
phosphate of iron, and an earthy oxide of iron.&nbsp; We do not
know much of the early history of Salmondby, the village of some
Saxon thane of the name of Salmond.&nbsp; The manor was
apparently the property of the Saxon Earl, Harold, but William
the Conqueror gave it to his nephew, Hugh de Abrincis, or
Avranches, surnamed &ldquo;Lupus,&rdquo; or the Wolf, from his
many deeds of violence, and it was held as part of the soke of
the more important manor, or honour, of Greetham.&nbsp; In an
ancient charter, found among the &ldquo;Final Concords&rdquo; (p.
359), it is stated that Geoffrey de Benigworth, grants to Avice,
wife of William de Benigworth, his manors of Walmersty,
Friskeney, Salmundesby, and Skreythesfeld (Scrafield), and all
appurtenances, saving the advowson of the church of Salmundesby,
which remains to Geoffrey and his heirs, and we have here an
example of how the common labourers were regarded as little
better than &ldquo;goods and chattels.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since,
herewith he grants all the villeins holding the
&ldquo;villeinages,&rdquo; or cottages, and &ldquo;all their
sequels,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, their progeny, &ldquo;to have and to
hold to the said Avice all her life,&rdquo; and after her
decease, the manors and services were to revert to the said
Geoffrey and his heirs for ever.</p>
<p>By will, dated 2 July, 1582 (&ldquo;Lincolnshire Wills,&rdquo;
1500, 1600, p. 105, No. 285), Margaret Littlebury, late wife of
Thomas Littlebury, Esq., of Stainsby, in the parish of Ashby
Puerorum, leaves money to the poor of Salmonby, Greetham, and
other places.&nbsp; This Margaret was the daughter of John St.
Paul, of Snarford, who, like the Dymokes, the Dightons,
Maddisons, Massingberds, and many other leading county families,
were mixed up in the <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>Lincolnshire Rebellion of
1536.&nbsp; The Littleburies were seated at Hagg and Somersby, as
well as at Stainsby, but they seem to have resided originally at
Holbeach Hurn.&nbsp; Sir Humphrey Littlebury, Lord of Littlebury,
was born, 1346.&nbsp; He married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress
of Sir John Kirton, knight, Lord of Kirton, and there is a fine
altar tomb of them both, in Holbeach church.&nbsp; His will was
dated, Dec. 1, 1330.&nbsp; But there was a Sir Ralph Littlebury,
knight, a juror at Holbeche, in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1293.</p>
<p>There would seem at one time to have been a substantial
manorial residence at Salmonby, for by will, dated 23 January,
1614, Edward King, of Ashby-de-la-Laund, devises &ldquo;to my
sonne, John Kinge, my manor house, of Salmondbie, <i>alias</i>
Salmonbie, with all appurtenances,&rdquo; also certain
&ldquo;closes,&rdquo; among them being the &ldquo;Rush Close,
Warlowe close, the Conie Hill, Huntepitts, Sheepe Walks, The
Lings, <i>alias</i> Gallows Hill, Rotten Fen, &amp;c., which
manor and lands were late in the tenure of Richard
Caterton.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds a codicil, dated &ldquo;9 day of
June, 1617,&rdquo; bequeathing to his said sonne, John Kinge,
various cottages, with his &ldquo;commons of Key-gaite, and
Sheepe-gait acre, and sheepe pasture in other places in
Salmonbie.&nbsp; Lastlie, I bequeath to my right worthie and
faithful friende, Sir John Meres, knight, a ring of gold of the
value of xl<i>s.</i>, to be inamiled on the outside, and within
to be ingraven these words, Donum Fidelis Amici.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This testator built the hall at Ashby-de-la-Laund in 1595.&nbsp;
The Kings took the side of the Parliament, and Colonel Edward
King distinguished himself.&nbsp; The last male heir, the Rev.
John King, died without issue, a few years ago.&nbsp; The manor
took its name from the two families, Essheby and De la Laund, who
held it till the reign of Henry VI.&nbsp; It has belonged to the
Kings since the reign of Henry VIII., but has now passed to
Colonel Neville H. Reeve.</p>
<p>A former rector of Salmonby, Phyllip Robert, clerk, by will,
dated 26 July, 1617, but not written in a clerkly style, desired
&ldquo;to be buried in the queare&rdquo; (choir) of the
church.</p>
<p>By a Chancery Inquisition (18 Henry VII., No. 46), it was
found that Hamon Sutton, held the manor of Salmonby, with
Maydenwell and others, and also the advowson of Salmonby, holding
them of the Lord the King, as of his Duchy of Lancaster, and in
the time of <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>Queen Elizabeth, Anthony Thorold, knight, is named in
certain documents still in the British Museum, as being lord of
the manor at that time.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Collectanea&rdquo; G.
Holles, vol., iii., p. 770.)</p>
<p>In 1415, John Kyghly, of Salmonby, a feoffe of Sir William
Cromwell, knight, presented to the chantry in Driby church,
because he, Sir William, was &ldquo;out of the
realm.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is probable that he was with Henry V. at
the battle of Agincourt, October 25, 1415.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Architectural Society&rsquo;s Journal,&rdquo; 1895, p.
124).</p>
<p>Among the Revesby charters is a deed of Symon, son of Gilbert
of Halton, and his wife Sarah, by which they jointly give to the
Abbey of Revesby, all &ldquo;their lands in Salmonby and in
Scraydesfield (Scrafield), and in Stickney, and all their claims
on the goods of Gilbert of Benniworth.&nbsp; Witnesses, Gilbert
Cusin, seneschal of the house of the Earl Chester, and
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; Date, temp. Hen. III.</p>
<p>The patronage of the benefice of Salmonby was at one time
attached to the crown, probably as an appurtenance of the honour
of Greetham and Duchy of Lancaster, but it has now passed into
private hands.&nbsp; In 1779, Henry Marshall, clerk, already
referred to, was patron and incumbent.&nbsp; Prior to 1840, W.
Bowerbank held the patronage and rectory.&nbsp; He was succeeded
by the late Rev. Henry Fielding, formerly Canon of Manchester,
next followed Rev. R. F. Ward, then for a brief period, Rev. F.
Cooper, and it is now held by the Rev. John Booth, who is also
patron.&nbsp; It has the unique distinction of having once been
held in commendam by William Patten, commonly known later as
William Waynflete, from his birth place, Wainfleet, in
Lincolnshire; that most munificent divine, Provost of Eton,
Bishop of Winchester, Lord Chancellor, Founder of Magdalen
College, Oxford, and of a free school at his native place.</p>
<p>The church, dedicated to St. Margaret, was until recent years,
an ivy-mantled structure, of the period Edwd. III. but it was
restored in 1871, during the incumbency of the Rev. R. Fawssett
Ward, at a cost of about &pound;600, who also enlarged the
rectory, and it now forms an interesting, well-kept and complete
church, in the Perpendicular style.&nbsp; It comprises nave,
chancel, south porch, and small spire, which contains one bell,
and stands at the N.E. corner of the chancel.&nbsp; The east
window was given by the late <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Henry James Fielding, Esq., eldest
son of the former rector, in memory of his father and
mother.&nbsp; It has five lights, with numerous compartments
above, and is filled with good coloured glass, the subjects
being, the Crucifixion above, and the Last Supper below, the
design adapted from a window in the Refectory at Milan.&nbsp;
There is a piscina in the south wall of the chancel.&nbsp; The
south wall has also one three-light, and one two-light window in
the Perpendicular style.&nbsp; The nave has, in the south wall,
one three-light, and one two-light window, and the porch door;
and in the north wall, one three-light window.&nbsp; The west
window again, of three lights, has good stained glass, in memory
of the Rev. Matthewman Manduel, for more than fifty years curate
or rector of Tetford; the subject is, Christ Blessing Little
Children.&nbsp; The tracery of all these windows is good.&nbsp;
There is an organ, by Nicholson, of Lincoln, with nine stops, and
handsome coloured pipes in front, the gift of the Rev. F.
Cooper.&nbsp; The chancel sedilia and choir stalls are of good
carved modern oak, by Messrs. Walter &amp; Hensman, of
Horncastle.&nbsp; The nave is fitted with open benches, which,
with the roof, are of pitch pine.&nbsp; The font is modern,
octagonal, with shields and roses floriated on alternate faces of
the bowl, supported by an octagonal shaft and pediment.&nbsp;
There is a graceful ogee arch as the priest&rsquo;s entrance to
the vestry.&nbsp; There was formerly in the nave of the church a
brass of a civilian of the 15th century, much defaced, but it
some years ago disappeared; it is mentioned among the list of
sepulchral brasses supplied to the Arch&aelig;ological Institute
on their visit to Lincoln in 1848, so that it still existed at
that date.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Journ. Arch&aelig;ol. Institute,&rdquo;
1848, p. lii, etc.)</p>
<p>The lady of the manor is now Mrs. Nesbitt Hamilton Ogilvy, as
representing the late Right Honble. Robert Adam Christopher
Nesbitt Hamilton, a staunch Protectionist, who was one of the
eight members of Parliament who voted to the last against the
abolition of the corn laws.&nbsp; Some of the land belongs to F.
S. Dymoke, Esq., and other smaller owners.</p>
<p>An interesting family heirloom preserved at the rectory, is a
massive silver urn-shaped cup, 13 inches high, which was
presented to Major Robert Booth, great uncle of the present
Rector, by the officers and privates of the Wainfleet Infantry
Volunteers, comprising three companies, <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>which were
raised at the time, when the first Napoleon was expected to
invade this country in 1808, and of which he was Major Commandant
(Oldfield&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Waynfleet&rdquo; 1829).</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Scamblesby</span>.</h3>
<p>This rather straggling village is pleasantly situated about 6
miles north-east of Horncastle, in a basin of the Wolds, between
the steep hill on the west, by which it is approached from
Horncastle and West Ashby, by the old turnpike road to Louth, and
the still steeper hill of Cawkwell, a mile further to the east,
Louth-ward.&nbsp; In the centre of this basin, which is watered
by a small tributary of the river Bain, rising near at hand, is
an almost circular prominence, like the boss of a shield, on
which fitly stands the church, above all the other human
erections.&nbsp; Only a few years ago, this was a very poor
structure of brick, although recent explorations have shewn that
there formerly existed a fair-sized edifice, with nave, aisles,
and chancel, fragments of which were built into the later brick
structure.&nbsp; This earlier church is said to have been
demolished about the middle of the 18th century.&nbsp; An
inscription in the west wall of the present fabric records that
&ldquo;The nave of this church was taken down, and rebuilt, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1893: Alfred Soden, Vicar; C. B.
Robson, J. R. Bourne, Churchwardens.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chancel had
been rebuilt in the previous incumbency of the Rev. T. White, by
the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, at a cost of &pound;400, in
1890&ndash;1.&nbsp; In the reconstruction, stone was utilized
from the small church of Cawkwell, the adjoining parish, which
had been disused and in a state of decay for some years, and was
not needed for the very small population of that parish, which is
now, for ecclesiastical purposes, annexed to Scamblesby.&nbsp;
The present erection of stone has a south door, with porch, and a
priest&rsquo;s door in the south wall of the chancel.&nbsp; The
nave has north and south aisles, of three bays; the easternmost
column in the south arcade is the original Norman, the rest being
modern, in similar style.&nbsp; In the north wall are three
lancet windows, the central one having two lights, the eastern
and western one light, and in the south wall <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>there are
two similar windows, one with two lights, the other with
one.&nbsp; The west end has two lancet windows, each with a
single light, and above them an ox-eye window, with smaller
lancets on either side of it.&nbsp; In the eastern wall of the
nave, on either side of the chancel arch, is a narrow lancet
window.&nbsp; In the chancel, the east window has two lights,
with quatrefoil above, two square-headed windows in the south
wall, and one in the north.&nbsp; The present font is modern, and
plain; the curious, massive, circular bowl of the old font, about
2ft. 8in. in diameter, in height more than 2ft., and with depth
of interior 1ft., large enough for immersion, stands outside the
porch.&nbsp; The seats of the nave are modern, of deal, but they
have very good old oak carved poppy-heads.&nbsp; The pulpit, of
oak, was presented as a memorial of the late Vicar, the Rev. T.
White, by his pupils; he having been formerly second master of
the Horncastle Grammar School; it already, however, shows signs
of decay.&nbsp; The chancel sedilia, of deal, were given by the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners.&nbsp; The communion table, of oak,
which is raised on two steps, was the gift of the present
Vicar.&nbsp; In the north wall of the chancel is a tablet,
commemorating, in Latin, and in quaint English verse, Margaret,
the daughter of Henry Coppinger, of a distinguished family in
Kent, and wife of &ldquo;Franciscus Thorndike,&rdquo; a lady,
&ldquo;imbued with a liberal piety from early years, who
religiously fulfilled her conjugal duties, and who, suffering
severely herself, also bore, as became a Christian, the loss of
three children, and then, with one only surviving, herself
yielded willingly to the call of God.&nbsp; Erected to a most
beloved wife, by the most sorrowing of husbands.&rdquo;&nbsp; No
date is given, but it has been found from the Herald&rsquo;s
College, that she was buried at Scamblesby, Dec. 30, 1629.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; iv., pp. 208&ndash;9).&nbsp;
Another member of this family, the brother of Francis, was the
Rev. Herbert Thorndyke, an eminent divine and worthy of
Lincolnshire, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, collated
prebendary of &ldquo;Layton Ecclesia&rdquo; in the cathedral of
Lincoln, by Bishop, afterwards Archbishop, Williams (in which
dignity he succeeded the well-known George Herbert), and later,
made a Prebendary of Westminster.&nbsp; He, by his will, dated
July, 3rd, 1672, bequeathed his estates in this parish to the
Dean and Chapter of Lincoln, for the endowment <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>of the
benefice, which, like that of the adjoining Cawkwell, was a very
poor one.&nbsp; Thorndyke&rsquo;s works form the 6th volume of
the Anglo-Catholic Library.&nbsp; That the family was one of good
position, is shewn by the fact of the name of Francis Thorndyke
appearing in the list of the Gentry of Lincolnshire, in 1634, as
&ldquo;of Scamblesby,&rdquo; also that of &ldquo;Herbert
Thorndyke, of Greenfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church is dedicated to St. Martin.&nbsp; Among the church
plate is a communion cup, bearing the inscription
&ldquo;Communion Cup, 1712,&rdquo; the Cawkwell cup is also old,
but not dated.&nbsp; The register of Scamblesby dates from 1569,
that of Cawkwell from 1685, but they contain no entries of
special interest.&nbsp; This was one of the many possessions of
the Norman, Ivo Taillebois, nephew of William the Conqueror, and
chief of the Angevin auxiliaries, who came over with the
Conqueror.&nbsp; After the death of the brave young Anglo-Saxon
nobles, Edwin and Morcar, the sons of Alfgar, and brothers-in-law
of King Harold, who refused to submit to the Norman yoke, their
sister, the Lady Lucia, was the last of that royal line, and,
being an unprotected female, William the Conqueror bestowed her
in marriage with all her many possessions, on Ivo.&nbsp; He
received with her, lands in Goulceby, Cawkwell, Asterby, and
other places, too many to enumerate.&nbsp; He was a man of
violent and tyrannous temperament, eventually, in the next reign,
being outlawed as an enemy of King Rufus.&nbsp; He was
subsequently allowed to return to this country, but not long
afterwards died of paralysis.&nbsp; According to accounts, more
or less authentic, the Lady, with a haste which was hardly
decent&mdash;though under the circumstances perhaps not
surprising&mdash;barely allowed one month to elapse (says the
chronicler, Peter de Blois), &ldquo;when she married that
illustrious young man, Roger de Romara, son of Gerald de
Romara,&rdquo; who had been seneschal or steward to William of
Normandy, before the Conquest; two other sons, Ralph and Edward,
subsequently being founders, the former, of the Tankervilles, and
the latter, of the Earls of Salisbury.&nbsp; By this marriage,
the large possessions of the Lady Lucia, passed to the
Romaras.&nbsp; Lucia herself had been a great benefactress to the
priory of Spalding, which had been founded by her uncle,
Vice-Comes, or Sheriff, Thorold of Buchenale.&nbsp; Among other
gifts she conveys to the monks of Spalding &ldquo;one watermill
(a valuable property in those days), and all her tithes in <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>Scamblesby,&rdquo; with much more in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Charters of Spalding Priory,&rdquo;
British Museum, D. n. 5).&nbsp; William de Romara, her son by her
husband Roger, in due course, following suit, founded the Abbey
of Revesby.&nbsp; In a later generation, the heiress of this
family, married Gilbert de Gaunt, who thus succeeded to the large
property, but it is probable that, on the occasions of each of
these changes, some of the demesnes were diverted in different
directions, and the changes were not few, as the Gaunts were
succeeded by the Blondvilles, they by the Lacys, and they again
by John of Gaunt, Earl of Richmond, 4th son of Edwd. III. whose
son was King Henry IV., of Bolingbroke.&nbsp; How long Scamblesby
remained a part of this heritage we are not able to say, but it
may be observed that in this varied line of descent (as indeed in
many others), there were various causes for the alienation, or
disintegration of large demesnes.&nbsp; The Sovereign&rsquo;s
power was absolute and most arbitrarily exercised, unless, as was
sometimes the case, the subject&rsquo;s power was greater.&nbsp;
The owners of large estates, and especially heiresses, were an
object of peculiar interest to Sovereigns, who by reason of war,
or their own extravagance, were not seldom more impecunious than
their powerful subjects.&nbsp; The actions of the latter were
carefully scanned, in order, if possible, that the Sovereign
might find an excuse for confiscation, partial or entire, of the
offender&rsquo;s property, and so replenish the royal
coffers.&nbsp; In the case of male proprietors, they could only
obtain coveted privileges, or even exercise their own undoubted
rights, on the payment of a very heavy fine.&nbsp; The times were
turbulent, rebellion was not uncommon, and a large landowner
sometimes found that he had espoused the unsuccessful cause,
whereupon he naturally incurred the penalty.&nbsp; In the case of
an heiress, a marriage contracted without the King&rsquo;s
license, was made sufficient ground for the royal displeasure,
and a heavy fine or deprivation was the result.&nbsp; Some, or
all of these causes were at work with different members of this
particular line.&nbsp; In the case of the attainder of Thomas,
Earl of Lancaster, even his divorced wife, Alicia, became subject
to a penalty of &pound;20,000, a very large sum in those days,
when pence were almost equivalent to our pounds.&nbsp; In this,
and other ways, the once vast possessions of the Thorolds, in
this part of the county, passed into other hands; although they
are <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>still one of the leading families on the other side of
it.&nbsp; Other families here came to the fore.&nbsp; On the
dissolution of the monasteries, any property which had been
granted by benefactors to those institutions, would pass, by
grant of the sovereign, to others, unless he retained it
himself.&nbsp; As we pass the small stream in Scamblesby, over
which a child could now leap, we may recognise it as a power that
once turned the mill-wheel of the Lady Lucia, or ground corn for
the tenants of the priors of Spalding, but it knows their name no
more.&nbsp; Some of the land, including the manor, passed to the
Bishop of Lincoln; until, in 1862, it was transferred to the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who are now the Lay Impropriators;
the living, now, after various augmentations, worth &pound;300 a
year, being in the patronage of the Bishop of Lincoln, and the
Earl of Yarborough.&nbsp; The latter nobleman is now one of the
largest proprietors in the county, though we believe he
originally belonged to the south of England, and was connected
with the Earls of Chichester, of Stanmer Park, in Sussex, in
which county the heraldic Pelham buckle is a marked feature in
many of the churches. <a name="citation178"></a><a
href="#footnote178" class="citation">[178]</a>&nbsp; Other
proprietors are the Lill and Bourne families.&nbsp; There is a
prebendal stall in Lincoln Cathedral, attached to Scamblesby in
conjunction with Melton Ross, which is now held by the Rev. Canon
Arthur Wright, rector of Coningsby, and Rural Dean of
Gartree.</p>
<p>There are rent charges for the poor of the parish, left by
David Atkinson and dame Tyrwhitt; also the interest of &pound;6
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, left by an unknown donor, and a charge on
land in Belchford, for poor widows.</p>
<p>Within a short distance of the church, in a south-eastward
direction, are traces of a moated inclosure, which has probably
been the site of a residence of some size.&nbsp; Nothing is known
of its past history, but it may well have been a mansion on the
property of the Countess Lucia, or some of her descendants, and
occupied by a dependent vassal.&nbsp; There are a few records of
former persons connected with the parish, of which we here give
one or two.&nbsp; Among the &ldquo;Final Concords,&rdquo; under
date, 1 July, 1202, is an agreement between Roger de Maletoft, on
the one <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>part, and Philip de Claythorp, and Mary his wife, on
the other part, tenants of &ldquo;4 oxgangs in Scamblesbi (about
60 acres),&rdquo; by which they acknowledge the said land to be
the right and inheritance of the said Roger; and in return for
this, he granted it &ldquo;to them and their heirs, to hold of
him and his heirs for ever, doing for it foreign service&rdquo;;
and, as an acknowledgment of this, the said Philip and Mary gave
the said Roger 4 marks.&nbsp; (Note appended to the will of John
Guevera, made 18 March, 1607.)&nbsp; N.B.&mdash;A sister of John
Guevera, married John Chapman, of Scamblesbi.&nbsp; The Guevera
family came from Biscay, in Spain, probably imported by Katherine
of Arragon, or Philip of Spain, Queen Mary&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>Thomas Kent, of Scamblesby, clerk, by will, dated 23 July,
1623, among other bequests, leaves, &ldquo;to my wife Mary,

he bequeaths the residence, after payment of debts and funeral
expenses.&nbsp; To be buried in the chancel of Scamblesbie.</p>

1625, bequeaths to &ldquo;my wife, Elizabeth, &pound;200, and the

Donington, to be executor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;On the death of the said Thomas Kent, Incumbent of
Donington, 13 years later, he leaves &ldquo;to my much honored
friend, Sir John Munson, my black colt; to Sir Thomas Munson, my
noble friend whom I much honor, my Spurr Royal; to the Right
Honble., my Lord Beaumont, my bald colt; to the Rectors of
Donington, for the time being, and their successors for ever, my
Spalding tythes (these were the gift of the Lady Lucia to
Spalding priory); to the repairs of St. Paul&rsquo;s church in
London, &pound;5.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name Scamblesby means the &ldquo;By,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>,
farmstead (Scotice Byre) of the Saxon Skamel; probably his land,
amounting to six carucates (or 720 acres), was that which,
through the Lady Lucia, became the property of Ivo Taillebois,
lord of Spalding.</p>
<p>The parish of Cawkwell, now ecclesiastically annexed to
Scamblesby, is of small extent, being a lordship comprising some
680 acres of land, now the property of the Duke of Portland; the
benefice, a vicarage now valued at &pound;39 a year, being in the
patronage of the Earl of Yarborough, who, as such, has the
alternate presentation with the Bishop of Lincoln, to the
consolidated benefice of Scamblesby with Cawkwell.&nbsp; This
property, again, was among the lands of Ivo Taillebois, acquired
by his marriage with the Saxon heiress, Lucia.&nbsp; Little is
known of its past history.&nbsp; It probably passed through the
like vicissitudes as Scamblesby, until it was granted to Sir
Charles Cavendish, of Bolsover Castle, and from him, passed to
the Dukes of Newcastle, the Earl of Oxford, and finally, by the
marriage of his daughter and heiress, to the noble family of
Bentinck, the ancestors of the present Duke of Portland, who, in
the present generation, has married a lady of the almost
neighbouring parish of Walmsgate.&nbsp; There was formerly a
priory of Cawkwell, of which Sir William Tyrwhitt was
steward.&nbsp; It was probably <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>not a richly endowed institution, as
his fee as steward was only &pound;1.&nbsp; It would seem to have
been a dependency of the much wealthier priory of Austin Canons,
at Nocton.&nbsp; (Dugdale &ldquo;Monasticon,&rdquo; vol. ii., p.
211)</p>
<p>The Church, dedicated to St. Peter, was demolished, and the
materials, in part, utilized for the rebuilding of Scamblesby
church, in 1893.&nbsp; At the date of Liber Regis (temp. Queen
Anne), the benefice was so poor that it is there described as
&ldquo;not presented to,&rdquo; and the church has not been used
for divine worship since 1885.&nbsp; Cawkwell house is a
substantial residence, standing in good grounds, and occupied by
C. B. Robson, Esq.&nbsp; The only thing worthy of note in
connection with this parish, is that it was the birth-place, in
1599, of a learned and pious man, Hanserd Knollys, who was
educated at Cambridge, distinguished for his zeal in religion,
appointed master of the Free School at Gainsborough, took Holy
Orders, and was presented by the Bishop of Lincoln to the living
of Humberston.&nbsp; Afterwards, conceiving scruples as to the
lawfulness of certain church observances, he resigned his
benefice; for a time, with the Bishop&rsquo;s connivance, he
preached in various parishes, without using the church
service.&nbsp; He eventually abjured his orders, and joined the
Baptist persuasion, and became one of its pastors in
London.&nbsp; The intolerance of the age forced him to seek
refuge in Wales, Holland, Germany, and even America.&nbsp; He
died, Sept., 1691, in the 93rd year of his age.&nbsp;

<p>We have mentioned Cawkwell hill.&nbsp; This is one of
&ldquo;the Alps of Lincolnshire,&rdquo; and, although there are,
among the Wold hills, several considerably steeper, being on a
high road, formerly having much traffic, it has been the scene of
some accidents.&nbsp; Only a few years ago, a gentleman living
near, was driving down the hill in a thunderstorm, when he was
struck by lightening, his carriage was upset, and his horse
afterwards found on the other side of the hedge, he himself
recovering without any serious effects.&nbsp; Sometime in the
forties, the late Sir Henry Dymoke was driving a carriage and
pair down the hill, when the horses bolted.&nbsp; The father of
the present writer happened at the time to be walking down the
hill, on his way home <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>from Louth; as the horses dashed
past him he made a spring at the bridle of the near horse,
fortunately catching hold of it, and by running alongside, he
succeeded in bringing the horses to a stand, without injury to
anyone.&nbsp; But for this timely aid, the champion of England
might have incurred a more serious ordeal than that of
challenging his sovereign&rsquo;s enemies.</p>
<p>The name of this parish, &ldquo;Calche uuelle,&rdquo; in
Domesday Book, and now Cawkwell, might have been given with
prophetic foresight into the future, as it is here, from a deep
well, the bore of which passes through the chalk to the gravel
below, that a pure and plentiful supply of water is obtained for
the town of Horncastle, and more recently also for the modern
health resort of Woodhall Spa.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Sotby</span>.</h3>
<p>Sotby, also in Liber Regis, called Saltby, lies to the west of
Ranby, about 2 miles to the north-west of Great Stourton, and is
about 8 miles north-north-west from Horncastle.&nbsp; Letters,
<i>via</i> Wragby, arrive at 9.30 a.m.&nbsp; This manor, in the
reign of the Conqueror, was granted by him to his half-brother,
Odo, Bishop of Baieux, <a name="citation182"></a><a
href="#footnote182" class="citation">[182]</a> along with many
other demesnes, as mentioned more fully in the account of
Ranby.&nbsp; Ralph the vassal of Odo is mentioned in Domesday
Book, as holding &ldquo;4 carucates,&rdquo; or 480 acres, with 16
socmen and 3 villeins.&nbsp; The Saxon thane, Ulnod, had about
the same extent.&nbsp; The church had 150 acres of meadow.&nbsp;
At an Inquisition, held 1 Edward II. (No. 107, 11 April, 1308),
it was shewn that Philip de Kyme, enfeoffed his son, William de
Kyme, of the manor of Sotteby, held by the service of half a
knight&rsquo;s fee.&nbsp; This William, in 1334, enfeoffed his
nephew, Gilbert de Umfraville, of the manor.&nbsp; He was Earl of
Angus.&nbsp; William&rsquo;s widow, Joan, married as her 2nd
husband, Nicholas de Cantelupe, who, through her, held the manor
of Baumber.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Architect. S. Journal,&rdquo; 1897, pp,
69, 70).&nbsp; <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>This Nicholas de Cantelupe, founded a chantry in
Lincoln Cathedral, dedicated to St. Nicholas.&nbsp; It is
situated to the east of the great south door, under the lesser
east window.&nbsp; On the north side of this chantry, are two
altar tombs, one of which, having a figure clad in surcoat of
mail, is the sepulchre of Lord Cantelupe.&nbsp; In the pavement
below, is a slab, in memory of his wife, the Lady Joan.&nbsp; She
founded a small chapel on the east side of the south transept,
dedicated to St. Paul.&nbsp; According to &ldquo;Testa de
Nevill,&rdquo; Simon de Kyme, at an earlier date, held lands in
Sotby, in chief from the king (circa, 1242).&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc.
N. &amp; Q.,&rdquo; iv., p. 174.&nbsp; Compare Oldfield&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Hist. Waynfleet,&rdquo; p. 168).</p>
<p>By a Close Roll, 9 Henry VII., No. 30, it is shewn that Sir
Robert Dymmok, knt., was, with others, seized of the manor of
Sotby, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1494.</p>
<p>By an Inquisition, taken 31 May, 1495 (10 Henry VII.), it was
found that Robert Taillebois, died seized of the manor of Sotby,
held from the king, by the service of half a knight&rsquo;s
fee.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N &amp; Q.&rdquo; ii., p. 141).&nbsp;
His ancestor, Ivo Taillebois, had lands in Baumber.</p>
<p>The abbot of Bardney had a pension from Sotby, as he also had
from Edlington and other parishes in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; At
the Lincolnshire Rising, in the reign of Hen. VIII., Thomas
Yoell, parson of Sotby, though old and blind took a prominent
part in the movement, along with the rectors of Low Toynton,
Belchford, and others.&nbsp; In 1798, Thomas Roe was
rector.&nbsp; The Rev. John Bainbridge-Smith, D.D., headmaster of
the Horncastle Grammar School, held the rectory of Sotby, with
that of Martin-by-Horncastle and the perpetual curacy of Baumber,
from 1828 to 1854; he was also Honorary Chaplain to the Duke of
Newcastle.&nbsp; He was succeeded at Sotby, by his son, John
Bainbridge-Smith, and the latter rebuilt the chancel of the
church, St. Peter&rsquo;s, and made other improvements in
1858&ndash;9.&nbsp; The register dates from 1658.&nbsp; Among the
entries is a record that in the year 1728, there were sixteen
burials, but no cause for that excessive mortality is
named.&nbsp; The second Rev. J. Bainbridge-Smith married a
daughter of Judge Haliburton, of Nova Scotia, the author of
&ldquo;Sam Slick,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Old Judge,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nature and Human Nature,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; He was for
some years chaplain at Smyrna.</p>
<p>When the chancel was taken down in 1858, some interesting
relics were discovered.&nbsp; A sepulchral arch was <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>opened at
the north-east end, supposed to lead to the burial place of the
founder of the Pre-Conquest Church.&nbsp; It was constructed of
grey stone.&nbsp; Three very ancient windows, also of grey stone,
and blocked with rubbish, were opened, on the splays of which
were found frescoes, the figures being, so far as they remained,
very distinct.&nbsp; One was a crowned figure, seated, and
holding a sceptre in his left hand, the right hand being
stretched out in the attitude of judgment or command, but the
lower part of the arm was wanting.&nbsp; Another was a female
figure, with long tresses, and a robe with lengthy train
behind.&nbsp; A third, was one figure complete, probably the
Saviour, with the head only of another figure, facing him,
probably the Magdalen; both heads being surrounded by a
nimbus.&nbsp; The Saviour&rsquo;s attitude, with uplifted finger,
indicated the giving of some command, probably the <i>Noli me
tangere</i>.&nbsp; The fourth subject was apparently a rude
representation of the last supper, the Saviour being in the act
of taking the cup. <a name="citation184"></a><a
href="#footnote184" class="citation">[184]</a>&nbsp; Copies of
these frescoes were made, and are preserved with the
registers.&nbsp; The present writer has copies, from which this
description is given.</p>
<p>When the south and east walls were taken down, a very ancient
doorway, probably Saxon, of grey and red sandstone was found;
close beside it was another doorway of later date.&nbsp; Towards
the east end of the south wall, was found a beautiful geometrical
window, the inner arch much broken.&nbsp; This had apparently
been the original east window, but in later times broken up, and
some of the fragments built into the wall in various parts.&nbsp;
All this seemed to indicate that a Saxon church had existed, that
it was rebuilt about the time of the Norman Conquest, with stone
found in the neighbourhood, that in the 13th century it was
adorned with frescoes, an east window, of Lincoln stone,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The new chancel was re-opened by the Bishop of
Lincoln, in 1859.&nbsp; (Extract from &ldquo;Lincolnshire
Times,&rdquo; Nov., 1859).</p>
<p>The chief features of the present church are as
follows:&mdash;The font, modern, octagonal, and plain.&nbsp; A
former very small font, with small bowl remains, sunk into the
base of a recess in the west wall.&nbsp; A small metal, portable
font, is also preserved in the rectory, which was formerly
used.&nbsp; <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>The chancel arch is probably Saxon.&nbsp; It is very
low, with massive supports, has been mutilated, but is still in
fairly good condition.&nbsp; In the south wall of the chancel is
a double piscina, supposed to be peculiar to the 13th
century.&nbsp; In the north chancel wall is an easter sepulchre,
with an aumbrey above, having a trefoil moulding in a 13th
century arch.&nbsp; The east window is modern, with three
lights.&nbsp; In the south wall is a two-light window, in memory
of J. B. Smith, D.D.&nbsp; In the floor of the chancel, in the
centre, is a slab commemorating John Porter, rector from 1658 to
1688&ndash;9.&nbsp; In the north wall of the nave is one
square-headed window; in the south wall are two similar
windows.&nbsp; On the north wall there is a tablet to J.
Scholey.&nbsp; There is only one small bell hanging in the bell
turret.&nbsp; Altogether this church has some very interesting
features.&nbsp; In the parish chest, with the registers, is a
copy made by the late rector, of the transcripts in the
Archidiaconal Registry, dating from 1556 to 1590.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Stixwould</span>.</h3>
<p>This parish is situated about 6 miles westward of Horncastle;
the village being less than a mile from the Stixwould station, on
the loop line of the Great Northern Railway, between Boston and
Lincoln.&nbsp; The parish is bounded on the west by the river
Witham, on the north by Horsington, and on the east and south by
Woodhall and Edlington.&nbsp; In Domesday book the name takes the
form of Stigeswald, or Stigeswalt.&nbsp; The origin of this name
can only be a matter of conjecture, but the following, as not
being without interest, is suggested.&nbsp; The ancient
arrangement for crossing a river, especially a sluggish, oozy
one, such as the Witham, was commonly by a stockaded ford. <a
name="citation185"></a><a href="#footnote185"
class="citation">[185]</a>&nbsp; This stockade would be
constructed of stakes or sticks, a kind of structure which is
also implied in the names Stickford, (<i>i.e.</i>, staked ford),
and Stickney (staked water, or island), both of which places lie
in what was <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>formerly a marshy district in this county. <a
name="citation186a"></a><a href="#footnote186a"
class="citation">[186a]</a>&nbsp; Hence, we may suppose, the
first syllable of the name Stix (or Sticks) wold; as to the next
syllable, &ldquo;Wold,&rdquo; or wald, is the Saxon for
wood.&nbsp; At some places certain woods were anciently assigned
by law or custom, for the supply of these stakes. <a
name="citation186b"></a><a href="#footnote186b"
class="citation">[186b]</a>; and such a wood might naturally
acquire the name of the Stakes wood, or Sticks wold.</p>
<p>In the case of this parish, as the embankment, now confining
the Witham to its narrow channel, did not anciently exist, that
river would then have a much greater width, and the ford would
probably be a long &ldquo;causeway&rdquo; through a morass,
raised by sods and strengthened by stakes. <a
name="citation186c"></a><a href="#footnote186c"
class="citation">[186c]</a>&nbsp; Mr. C. Gowen-Smith, the
translator of Domesday Book, for Lincolnshire, says
(Introduction, p. xl.) that &ldquo;wad,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;wode,&rdquo; means &ldquo;a causeway.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
thus, on either of these suppositions, get Stixwould meaning a
staked ford, or causeway. <a name="citation186d"></a><a
href="#footnote186d" class="citation">[186d]</a></p>
<p>In the days of ancient savage warfare, fords were important
positions of defence; and especially on the Witham would a ford
be important, that river being the boundary between the barbarous
&ldquo;Girvii,&rdquo; who inhabited the wild Fen tracts, <a
name="citation186e"></a><a href="#footnote186e"
class="citation">[186e]</a> and the less warlike Saxons, who
dwelt east of it.&nbsp; A ford also, or ferry, was a source of
considerable revenue; for instance, at Stow, the lord of the
manor, in 1234, let the ferry on the Trent (now of
Littleborough), with the fishery, for &pound;3 6<i>s.</i>
8<i>d.</i> yearly, <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>a large sum in those days.&nbsp; Thus the staked ford,
and the wood supplying the stakes, may well have been local
features of sufficient importance to originate the name of
Stickswold.</p>
<p>Of the wood formerly existing, there are still some relics, in
fine oak trees of great age; one of these, nearly 20ft. in girth,
is to be seen by the garden gate at the abbey farm house; another
stands near the drive to Halstead Hall, in the east of the
parish; and others are nearer the Witham, in fields adjoining
Newstead House farm.&nbsp; The present Stixwould wood, or Long
wood, south of the village, is of comparatively modern growth;
but on the eastern border of the parish is Halstead wood,
separated from Sto-bourne wood, by what, probably, was formerly a
&ldquo;stow,&rdquo; &ldquo;stoke,&rdquo; or stake-marked
&ldquo;bourn,&rdquo; or boundary stream, being a ditch of running
water, which gives its name to the latter wood, which lies in the
next parish; the two woods until recent years, belonging to the
two different manors.</p>
<p>At the time of the Norman Conquest, we find only two names of
Saxon landowners in this parish, viz.:&mdash;Ulviet, and Siward,
who had here between them, about 720 acres.&nbsp; Both these
would seem to have been thanes of some importance, as the former
held, in demesne or otherwise, lands in at least ten other
parishes, in various parts of the county; and the latter had
lands in eleven parishes, also widely distributed, and further,
had sufficient influence to continue as tenant, under the Norman
proprietors, to whom the Conqueror transferred the lands
previously owned by Saxons. <a name="citation187"></a><a
href="#footnote187" class="citation">[187]</a>&nbsp; Of Normans,
a grant of 270 acres (that amount having been previously owned by
<a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Ulviet,)
was conferred by King William, upon Waldin Brito (or the Breton),
a distinguished soldier, who accompanied him from Normandy.&nbsp;
These Bretons were highly valued for their faithful services, by
the Plantagenet kings, and were largely employed in court
offices; Waldin also received manors in eight other parishes in
this neighbourhood.&nbsp; Another favourite of the Conqueror, who
received land here, was Alured, of Lincoln.&nbsp; The Domesday
Survey gives him as owning 180 acres of arable, meadow, and wood
land in Stixwould, with fifty-one manors in the county, beside
lands elsewhere.</p>
<p>A still larger proprietor was Ivo Taillebois, Earl of Anjou,
and nephew of the Conqueror.&nbsp; On him, William bestowed in
marriage, the Saxon Lady Lucia, sister of Edgiva, wife of the
late King Harold.&nbsp; Beside the lands of her father, Earl
Algar, she had succeeded to the large possessions of her uncle,
Sheriff Thorold, of the neighbouring Bucknall (where traditions
still linger of him, and his sister, the &ldquo;Lady
Godiva.&rdquo;)&nbsp; She was probably a kinswoman of the above
Alured, of Lincoln, since his relative, Alan of Lincoln, is named
in old deeds, as nephew of Thorold.&nbsp; Either through her, or
by direct grant to himself, Ivo owned 1,020 acres in Stixwould,
beside lands in 104 other parishes.&nbsp; On this Ivo Taillebois
(or &ldquo;Underwood&rdquo; as the name signifies), we may here
make a few remarks.&nbsp; He was commonly known as &ldquo;the
Lord of Holland,&rdquo; through his wife&rsquo;s extensive
possessions in that division of the county, inherited from
Thorold, her uncle, who was lord of Spalding, and he also had a
fine residence at Spalding, where he lived in great state.&nbsp;
He was, however, of a temperament fitted rather to inspire fear
than affection.&nbsp; The chronicler, Ingulphus (&ldquo;History
of Croyland Abbey,&rdquo;) tells us, that his dependants
&ldquo;supplicated him on bended knees, and did him all due
service,&rdquo; but, in return, he &ldquo;tortured, harrassed,
and daily loaded them with fresh burdens&rdquo;; and by his
cruelty, &ldquo;compelled most of them to sell their property and
seek other countries.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the death of his patron,
the Conqueror, he joined a conspiracy against William Rufus, and
was banished the country.&nbsp; After a few years he was allowed
to return, but died shortly afterwards of paralysis, in 1114. <a
name="citation188"></a><a href="#footnote188"
class="citation">[188]</a>&nbsp; Having been <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>forced as a
husband, by the Conqueror, upon the Lady Lucia, and being further
of the temperament already described, we may assume that, as the
saying is, there was &ldquo;no love lost&rdquo; between them, and
we are therefore hardly surprised to find another old chronicler
(Peter de Blois), saying, on the death of Ivo, &ldquo;hardly had
a month elapsed, when the Lady Lucia married that illustrious
man, Roger de Romara, son of Gerald de Romara (seneschal or high
steward of William, as Duke of Normandy), and that she lost all
recollection of Ivo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are the only two landowners, Saxon or Norman, mentioned
in Domesday Book, as having property in Stixwould.&nbsp; The
extent of their lands in the parish, all added together, amounted
to rather less than 2,000 acres, whereas the present acreage is
nearly 2,360, there is therefore a margin of between 300 and 400
acres unaccounted for; and this we may probably assume to have
been waste land of bog and morass, subject to the Witham floods,
and not brought under cultivation till centuries later.&nbsp;
Accordingly, we find that the parish rate-book shows a sudden
rise in value of certain land, owing to drainage early in the
nineteenth century.&nbsp; We are not able to trace the successive
landowners of Stixwould through a connected series.&nbsp; There
would seem to be some confusion in the old chroniclers, between
the Lady Lucia, who married Ivo Taillebois, and another lady of
the same name, probably her daughter, who married Roger de
Romara, <a name="citation189a"></a><a href="#footnote189a"
class="citation">[189a]</a> and, on his death, married Ranulph,
Earl of Chester.&nbsp; The eldest son of this Lady Lucia, by
Roger de Romara, was William de Romara, who was created Earl of
Lincoln, by King Stephen, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1140.&nbsp; His grandson, also William de Romara, married
Philippa, daughter of John Count d&rsquo; Alencon, <a
name="citation189b"></a><a href="#footnote189b"
class="citation">[189b]</a> but died childless.&nbsp; His
property would then <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>pass to the descendants of the
second husband of the Lady Lucia II., viz., Ranulph, Earl of
Chester.&nbsp; The latter married his niece, the Countess Roheis,
to Gilbert de Gaunt, whose grandfather was nephew of Matilda,
wife of William the Conqueror.&nbsp; He became Earl of Lincoln,
and it is probable that the Earl of Chester&rsquo;s property
passed to him; among other such lands, being also those in
Stixwould, and in this connection, it is interesting to note
that, although in a less exalted position, there are still, in
this twentieth century, Gaunts in this parish, whose very
countenance would bespeak their Norman origin.&nbsp; In course of
time, the lands of the Gaunts, passed, in great measure, to two
families, namely, that of the Becks of Lusby, Spilsby, &amp;c.,
and the Pinsons of Tattershall, &amp;c.&nbsp; These two families
flourished during the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries, and they,
in turn, were succeeded by the Willoughbys, ancestors of the
present Earl of Ancaster, and Lord Willoughby
d&rsquo;Eresby.&nbsp; A Court Roll, 9 Richard I., shows that
Robt. Willoughby had then land in the adjoining Wispington, but
there is indirect evidence to show that the Willoughbys had also
property in Stixwould, since, in the twenty-second year of Edwd.
III. (1348), John, the first Lord Willoughby d&rsquo;Eresby,
endowed the chantry of the Holy Trinity, at Spilsby, with certain
lands in Stixwould, Fulletby, and other parishes (Pat., 22 Ed
III); while further, in a charter of Baron Bek (circa 1300),
conveying lands to Kirkstead Abbey, we find as witnesses to the
deed, William de Wylcheby (<i>i.e.</i>, Willoughby), two Beks,
William de Thorp, and &ldquo;Dominus,&rdquo; Theobald de
Hallested (&ldquo;Architect. S. Journal,&rdquo; 1897, p. 38);
thus connecting, again, Halstead, or Stixwould, with a
Willoughby, as well as his relatives, the Beks, of Spilsby, and
the owners of Tattershall Thorpe.</p>
<p>At an earlier date than this, however, we find mention of
other owners of Stixwould.&nbsp; In a list of landowners in
Lindsey, in the reign of Henry I. (1100, 1135), we find Alan of
Lincoln (already referred to as kinsman of Alured), owning six
oxgangs (ninety acres), in this parish, with Gilbert
Fitz-Gozelin, and Gerard as his tenants, as Siward had been under
Alured; also Robert de Hay, owning here, one carucate (120
acres).&nbsp; (Cotton MSS., Claudius, C 5, fol. 9<i>b.</i>, Brit.
Museum, &ldquo;Archit. Journ.,&rdquo; 1881, p. 197.)</p>
<p>The de Hays were a wealthy family, owning lands in
Cammerigham, Spridlington, Fillingham, Hackthorn, <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>Owmby,
Barlings and many other parishes.&nbsp; (Ibid, pp. 184, 185,
&amp;c.)&nbsp; One of them was among the Barons who signed the
Magna Charter.</p>
<p>At the same date, we find a certain Ralph de Stixwald, holding
land in Edlington, as tenant under Ranulph le Meschin; the latter
being the second husband of the (second) Lady Lucy, Earl of
Chester, and son of the Vicomte de Bessin, in Normandy.&nbsp;
(Ibid., fol. 14, and &ldquo;Arch&aelig;olog. S.
Proceedings,&rdquo; 1848, p. 257).</p>
<p>Near the close of this 12th century (1 and 3 Richard I., 1190
and 1192), we find Roger de Stixwald (with Gerard de Camvill),
Sheriff of the County.&nbsp; He was probably son of the above
Ralph de Stixwould.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Hist. Lincoln,&rdquo; 1816, p.
200).&nbsp; These de Stikswalds resided at Halstead Hall, in this
parish, which will be noticed hereafter under that head.</p>
<p>By an Inquisition, taken at Wragby (5 Richard II.,
1381&ndash;2), it was shewn that Margaret, wife of John de Orbi,
knight (Orby), held jointly with her husband, fifty-two acres of
wood in Tattershall and Stixwold, with various other lands; and
that Mary de Percy, wife of John de Roos, is their next heir; but
that her brother, the Earl of Northumberland, occupied the land
meanwhile.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; vol. vi., No.
47).&nbsp; Her will was proved 29th Augt. 1394.&nbsp; Mentions of
other owners in subsequent times are rather rare.</p>
<p>On the Dissolution of the Monasteries, by Hen. VIII., that
sovereign in 1541, gave the lands of Stixwould Priory in this
parish, to Robert Dighton.&nbsp; The Dightons had amassed
considerable wealth, as merchants in Lincoln.&nbsp; A Robert
Dighton was Mayor in 1494, and again in 1506, and William Dighton
was Sheriff in 1533.&nbsp; The Robert Dighton, who thus became a
landowner in Stixwould, resided at the old hall of Stourton
Parva, in the parish of Baumber, dividing the ownership of that
parish with the Earls of Lincoln, afterwards Dukes of
Newcastle.&nbsp; He married Joyce, daughter and heiress of
William St. Paul; the St. Pauls being a good family, later
represented by Sir George St. Paul, Bart., who died in
1613.&nbsp; Robert Dighton&rsquo;s daughter, married first, Judge
Dalison, and secondly, Sir F. Ayscough, Bart.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Archit. Journ.,&rdquo; 1891, p. 16).&nbsp; Members of
both these families took part in the Lincolnshire Rising of 1536,
along with John Heneage, Edwd. Dymoke (Sheriff), William
Willoughby, Thimblebies, <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Massingberds, and many others.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;State Papers,&rdquo; Henry VIII., vol. ii. p. 971,
&ldquo;Architect. S. Journal,&rdquo; 1894. pp. 174,
&amp;c).&nbsp; A daughter of Thomas Dighton married Edwd.
Clinton, second son of the first Earl of Lincoln, of that line
(temp. Elizabeth.)</p>
<p>Another family, here comes on the scene, viz., the Thimblebys,
who resided at Poolham, a hamlet of the adjoining parish of
Edlington; and for some generations owned land in
Stixwould.&nbsp; Their chief residence was at Irnham, near Bourn,
where Richard Thimbleby Esq., in 1510, built the hall, a fine
mansion, standing in a well-wooded deer park; having acquired the
property by marriage with an heiress of the Hiltons, whose
ancestor, Sir Geoffrey Hilton, again, had obtained it by marriage
with an heiress of the Luterels; that family having also
succeeded to it in the person of Sir Andrew Luterel, who married
an heiress of the Paganels, on whose ancestor, the Norman, Ralph
Paganel, it had been bestowed by the Conqueror.&nbsp; The
pedigree of the Thimblebys is given in the Herald&rsquo;s
Visitation of 1562.&nbsp; They owned property in Claxby,
Normanby, Tetford (manor with advowson), Haltham, High Toynton,
Horsington (with moiety of advowson), and many other
parishes.&nbsp; They doubtless took their name from the proximate
parish of Thimbleby, as we find them first designated as John,
Thomas, &amp;c., &ldquo;de Thimbleby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By a Chancery Inquisition post mortem, of date, 1333 (7 Ed.
III.), taken on Friday after the feast of St. Matthew (Sep. 21),
at Haltham, it was shewn that Nicholas de Thymelby held certain
land in Haltham, of the right of his wife Matilda, with lands in
Thimbleby, under the Bishop of Carlisle, and lands in Stikeswold,
of the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln.&nbsp; He was succeeded by his
son John, who married Isabel, daughter and co-heir of Sir William
Fflete, knt., and his successor, William Thymelby, Esq.,
apparently married Joan, daughter of Sir Walter Taillebois, one
of the family connected with Stixwould, through the Lady Lucia,
already named, nearly 400 years earlier; Sir Walter was
grandnephew of Gilbert Umfravill, Earl of Angus.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Architect. Journ.,&rdquo; 1896, pp. 297&ndash;8).</p>
<p>Again (nearly 200 years later), by a Court of Ward&rsquo;s
Inquisition (3, 4, 5, Ed. VI.,) it was shown that Matthew
Thimbleby, who married Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Hussey, was
seised of lands in Styxwolde, Horsington, <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Edlington,
Thymylby, Buckland (<i>i.e.</i> Woodhall), &amp;c., inheriting
them from his father (Ibid. p. 258).&nbsp; His widow married Sir
Robert Savile, knt., of Poolham, and through her, he died in
1585&ndash;6 (Jany. 24), seised of the same land in Stixwolde,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>We now pass over eighty years, during which another change in
the ownership has taken place.</p>
<p>In 1665, and again in 1685, Sir John Coventry, K.B. presented
to the benefice, and was probably lord of the manor.&nbsp; At the
beginning of the 18th century, Sir Thomas Keate had succeeded as
patron (Ecton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thesaurus,&rdquo; p. 183) and his
widow, Agnes Keate, was owner in 1704.&nbsp; (Liber Regis, p.
424).&nbsp; This name is written Kyte, in the &ldquo;Histories of
Lincolnshire,&rdquo; by Weir, and by Saunders.&nbsp; They are
said to have been a Warwickshire family; the last of them, Sir
William, squandered a large fortune, and, in a fit of despair,
set fire to his fine mansion in the Cotswold hills, and himself
perished in the flames.&nbsp; The manor of Stixwould had been
previously sold by him to Lord Anson, the distinguished Naval
Commander, and Circumnavigator, Lord High Admiral of England,
&amp;c., who presented to the benefice in 1753.&nbsp; On his
death, in 1762, his son, Thomas Anson, Esq., of Shuckborough, Co.
Stafford, succeeded to the property, and presented to the
benefice in 1767.</p>
<p>In 1763, Mary Lister, fourth daughter of Matthew Lister, Esq.,
of Burwell Park, near Louth, married (19 May), Thomas Elmhirst,
Esq., of Stixwould (Parish Register of Burwell, quoted
&ldquo;Archit. Soc. Journal,&rdquo; 1897, p. 92).&nbsp; He was
probably at that time tenant of the Abbey Farm House.&nbsp;
Matthew Lister, her father, had married Grace, widow of Sir
Edward Boughton, Bart., daughter, and co-heir of Sir John
Shuckborough, Bart., of Shuckborough, at which place also resided
the above-named Thomas Anson, son of Lord Anson.</p>
<p>The whole estate of Stixwould was afterwards purchased by
Edmund Turnor, Esq., of Stoke Rochford, who first presented to
the benefice in 1778, his nominee, as Vicar, being a member of a
very old Lincolnshire family, Bernard Cracroft, who also held the
Vicarage of Bardney.&nbsp; A former Sir Edmund Turnor was
knighted by Charles II., in 1663, as a reward for services
rendered to that king&rsquo;s martyred father.&nbsp; The property
still remains with this family.&nbsp; Among the gentry of
Lincolnshire named at the Heralds&rsquo; <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>Visitation
in 1634, is Edwd. Broxholme &ldquo;of Stixwould,&rdquo; who seems
to have had relatives at Lincoln, North Kelsey, Grimsby,
Nettleham, and elsewhere among the county gentry; one of them,
John of Otbye, contributing &pound;25 to the national loan for
defence against the Spanish Armada.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp;
Q.&rdquo; ii., pp. 9 and 134).&nbsp; Whether this Edward
Broxholme was a landowner in Stixwould, or a tenant, does not
appear.&nbsp; He resided at the Priory.</p>
<p>We now give a brief notice of Stixwould Priory, dedicated to
the blessed Virgin Mary.&nbsp; This was founded by the Lady Lucia
(<i>i.e.</i>, the second of that name), and her two sons,
Ranulph, Earl of Chester, and William de Romara, Earl of Lincoln
(Leland &ldquo;Collect.,&rdquo; vol. i., p. 92), in the reign of
Stephen.&nbsp; The Rev. Thos. Cox, in his
&ldquo;Lincolnshire&rdquo; (of date, 1719), ascribes the
foundation to Galfred de Ezmondeys. <a name="citation194"></a><a
href="#footnote194" class="citation">[194]</a>&nbsp; Doubtless,
at different periods, additions and augmentations were made to
the original institution, entitling the benefactors to be
numbered among the &ldquo;fundatores&rdquo;; but the general
testimony of Leland, Dugdale, and others, is in favour of the
Lady; whose uncle, Sheriff Thorold, was a benefactor to Croyland
Abbey, and founded Spalding Priory, his sister, the Lady Godiva,
also (as the Chronicler Henry of Huntingdon tells us), spending
much of her vast wealth in building monasteries and churches,
while her descendant, William de Romara II., founded Revesby
Abbey.&nbsp; By an Inquisition taken 3 Edwd. I. (1275), it was
found that the lands held by the Priory, given by these and other
benefactors, had been so held for 100 years (Dugdale&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Monasticon&rdquo; i., p. 56, No. 486); and further, by an
Inquisition at Stamford, in the same reign, it was found that the
Priory had certain lands at Huntingdon, from divers benefactors
(&ldquo;Ibid.&rdquo; ii., p. 223, No. 809), one of these being
Alexander Creveceur, a member of a distinguished Norman family,
who owned lands in Somersby, circa <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, 1242, and in several other parishes
in this neighbourhood; the name also appearing in the Battle
Roll.&nbsp; They <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>are now represented by the de Courcy&rsquo;s whose
chief, Lord Kinsale, is premier Baron of Ireland, and entitled by
royal warrant to the singular privilege of keeping his hat on in
the Sovereign&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; Besides the Huntingdon
property, the Priory possessed house property in Lincoln, 900
acres of land in Honington, 120 in Bassingthorpe, 120 in
Bucknall, 42 in Wyberton, 249 in Stixwould, with the advowson of
the Church; smaller amounts in Westby, Waynfleet, Horkstow,
Wymondham, Low Toynton, Tupholme, the advowson of Waynfleet
benefice; 2 tofts in Horsington, to provide candles for the
altar, and a pension from Alford; while the Prioress also
received as lesser perquisites, obits, mortuaries, Easter
offerings, &ldquo;shot for wax,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lincoln
farthings,&rdquo; &ldquo;Assize of bread and beer,&rdquo; and
various &ldquo;fines and amerciaments.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Oliver&rsquo;s &ldquo;Religious Houses,&rdquo; pp. 65, 6.)</p>
<p>As to the particular ecclesiastical order to which this Priory
belonged, authorities differ.&nbsp; In Thomas Coxe&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Lincolnshire&rdquo; (already referred to), it is called a
Gilbertine Institution; Stukeley (in his &ldquo;Itinerarium
Curiosum,&rdquo; vol. i., p. 88), calls it Benedictine; while
Dugdale, in his &ldquo;Monasticon,&rdquo; vol. i., No. 486,
places it among the Benedictines, and in vol. ii., No. 809, gives
it as Gilbertine; while Noble and others call it
Cistercian.&nbsp; The Cistercians, however, were only a stricter
sect of the Benedictines.&nbsp; The early training of Gilbert had
been mainly Cistercian, and we shall therefore probably be right
in saying that Stixwould Priory was at first a Gilbertine, and
afterwards changed to a Benedictine establishment of the
strictest order.&nbsp; As to the strictness of the regulations,
we gather full evidence from the accounts given by Dr. Oliver, in
his &ldquo;Religious Houses on the Witham,&rdquo; from which we
here make a few quotations.&nbsp; We may premise that, although
the sisterhood consisted nominally of a Prioress and Nuns, there
was a resident male &ldquo;Master of the Nuns&rdquo; (Court
Rolls, 6 Richard I.); and, at times, at least, according to
Leland (&ldquo;Collect.,&rdquo; i., p. 92), there were also
&ldquo;Brothers&rdquo; (fratres), as at the Sempringham House,
which Gilbert founded.&nbsp; The time of the nuns was chiefly
spent in works of charity, reading legends of the Saints,
solitary meditation and prayer (a perfunctory repetition of
devotions, which must too often have been deadening, rather than
invigorating, to spiritual life), and <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>needlework, such as the embroidery
of altar cloths, &amp;c. <a name="citation196a"></a><a
href="#footnote196a" class="citation">[196a]</a>&nbsp; They were
not even allowed to converse with each other, except on
permission from the Prioress; they could only converse with
friends from outside through a grating &ldquo;of the length of a
finger, and barely a thumb&rsquo;s breadth,&rdquo; and with a
veil over it, in the presence of two &ldquo;discreet
sisters&rdquo;; and all letters were inspected by the
Prioress.&nbsp; The Convent was so shut in by walls, as
&ldquo;scarcely (it was said) to leave an entrance for
birds,&rdquo; and, during divine service, the door of the choir,
where they sat, was closed, so that they could not see, or be
seen by, strangers.&nbsp; The diet was of the plainest, and if a
nun was disobedient, it was reduced to bread and water.&nbsp;
They were not allowed to go beyond the Priory walls except to
visit the sick, or attend funerals; and even in the Priory
garden, usually a resort for monastic recreation, but an
indulgence only granted to these sisters on Sundays and
festivals, they were allowed to pluck only jessamine and violets,
except by special permission.&nbsp; These rules, however, were
occasionally relaxed; they were permitted to cultivate music and
dancing, and even to attend the village sports (Oliver, p. 67,
note 8); and the Prioress, who by charter had free warren over
the Priory lands, is said to have indulged in hawking and hunting
(Placit. de quo Warranto, 22 Edwd. I.) <a
name="citation196b"></a><a href="#footnote196b"
class="citation">[196b]</a>&nbsp; This house was dissolved with
more than 600 other monastic establishments by Henry VIII. in the
27th year of his reign (<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1536);
a year later he founded in its place, and with the same revenues,
&ldquo;for the good of his soul, and that of his Consort
Jane,&rdquo; a Premonstratensian house, which, however, only
continued two years, when it, in turn, was abolished.&nbsp; The
last Prioress under the old regime was Helena Key; the first and
only Prioress, under the new regime, being Mary Missenden
(Dugdale &ldquo;Monast.,&rdquo; iii., No. 81.)&nbsp; The estates,
as already mentioned, were bestowed, on the final dissolution of
this house, <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>upon Robert Dighton.&nbsp; According to Speed, the
historian, the value of the estates was &pound;163 1<i>s.</i>
2&frac12;<i>d.</i>, which was in those days a considerable
sum.&nbsp; The steward for some of the Lindsey estates of the
Priory was John Heneage, brother of Sir Thomas Heneage of
Hainton; for others of the estates in the same division, Sir
Robert Dymoke; for the estates in Kesteven, Sir Robert Hussey, a
younger brother of Lord Hussey, of Sleaford; these two brothers
having between them no less than 23 stewardships for religious
houses, that post being one of no small emolument.</p>
<p>Nothing now remains of the Priory itself, beyond some stone
coffins lying close to the north wall of the parish church, which
were found to the west of the Abbey Farm house.&nbsp; There
remained, however, until 1846, when they were removed to give
space for the present farm buildings, a postern gate, and the
east end of the Priory chapel <a name="citation197"></a><a
href="#footnote197" class="citation">[197]</a> with a window of
the date of Edwd. III.; under the arch of the gateway were the
arms of the Leake family of Lincolnshire carved on a truss of
wood, &ldquo;Argent a chief, gules, over all a bend engrailed,
azure.&rdquo;&nbsp; A rough sketch of these remains by Mr.
Willson, architect, is in the possession the lord of the manor
and from it a sketch is given by the Rev. J. A. Penny, late
Vicar, in vol. iii., of &ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; p.
161.&nbsp; The moat round the Priory enclosed an area of about 4
acres, and was connected with the Witham, about three-quarters of
a mile distant, doubtless for the conveyance of goods to the
monastery, as well as for the renewal of the moat water, and that
of the stew ponds, a matter of some importance where a supply of
fish was required for the &ldquo;fasting&rdquo; diet of
&ldquo;the religious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now proceed to a description of the church, dedicated to
St. Peter, which possesses features of more than usual
interest.&nbsp; This was rebuilt in 1831, the architect being Mr.
W. A. Nicholson, of Lincoln.</p>
<p>The former building was on the same site as the present, but
larger.&nbsp; Wilson (architect, of Lincoln), in a MS. collection
of churches (vol. ii., p. 87), has the following notes on the <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>earlier
fabric:&mdash;&ldquo;Stixwould, spacious; has been elegant, full
of curious remnants; style, Edwd. VI. or Henry VIII.; tower very
handsome, but much decayed, the walls being built of soft-grained
stone (<i>i.e.</i>, the usual &lsquo;Spilsby&rsquo;
sandstone).&nbsp; Interior has been very beautiful, lofty pointed
arches, roof of nave and south aisle supported on rich carved
figures of angels, with shields, etc.; windows full of scattered
remnants of beautiful stained glass; old oak desks and benches
with carved (finials); curious font; upper end of south aisle
inclosed by two screens of oak, mutilated, but exquisitely rich
and elegant; this is called &lsquo;the little choir,&rsquo; and
belongs to Halstead Hall in Stixwould; choir screen very lofty,
with front of rood-loft over it, painted with Ten Commandments,
in &lsquo;black letter&rsquo;; choir same date as nave; east
window spoilt; some ancient slabs, one of two children of the
Welby family (this is now lost) in the little choir; both aisles
have had altars; two bells; curious stone, with letters like a
clock face, in front of tower <a name="citation198"></a><a
href="#footnote198" class="citation">[198]</a> (N.B.&mdash;This
was removed some years ago, to Newport, Lincoln, but has been
seen at Stixwould by the present writer).&nbsp; Base and part of
pillar of churchyard cross remain; Mr. Turnor (lord of the
manor), took some painted glass from the church &lsquo;to the
Hall at Stoke Rochford&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; So far, Mr.
Willson.&nbsp; We may add that the panels of the pulpit of Lea
Church, 12 miles beyond Lincoln, were taken from Stixwould.</p>
<p>As to the present fabric, I have been favoured with the
following observations by the Rev. J. Alpass Penny, Vicar of
Wispington, formerly of Stixwould.&nbsp; The church consists of
nave, chancel, and a good tower containing two bells; one of
these being exactly the same as that in the Guildhall at Lincoln,
with date 1370, dedicated to &ldquo;St. Katrine,&rdquo; with
Nottingham foundry mark, founder&rsquo;s initials, and
merchant&rsquo;s mark.&nbsp; The pinnacles and figures on the
tower are from the former tower; the choir screen, now only one
third of the original, consists of three equal-sized bays, the
central one forming a doorway; and has been pronounced by Dr. F.
Mansel Sympson (&ldquo;Architectural S. Journal,&rdquo; 1890, p.
211) to be &ldquo;of excellent work;&rdquo; it has however, <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>been
recently removed, by the late vicar (in 1899), from the chancel
arch to its eastern wall, and now forms a rather elegant
reredos.&nbsp; The chancel was enlarged, and the nave reseated,
in 1864.&nbsp; The stone slab in the nave floor, nearest to the
Chancel arch, of date 1722, is in memory of a Boulton, who, as
well as his ancestors for several generations, resided at the
Abbey Farm house: he stabbed his mother to death in the little
chapel outside the Priory gate, no longer existing. <a
name="citation199"></a><a href="#footnote199"
class="citation">[199]</a>&nbsp; The stone figure-heads and
angels within the church belonged to the former edifice, as did
also the bench ends south of the nave.&nbsp; The royal arms, with
date 1662, formerly in the church, are now in a wall of the
entrance hall at the Abbey Farm house; and the holy water stoup
is now under the pump in the school yard.&nbsp; There is a fine
slab, with cross, lying outside the tower, which was dug up on
the site of the Priory, also a stone coffin; other fragments were
found in the vicarage garden.&nbsp; The font is octagonal,
divided into panels by rich pinnacles with lions and flowers, the
panels bearing four quaintly-cut emblems of the Evangelists, with
names in black letter, but now very indistinct; the figures
between them being a monk, seated in chair, and holding Y in his
hand, representing January; next, a man with arms akimbo, facing
east, meaning February; next, a friar, for March; and next, a man
in flat cap with sword, holding a rose in his left hand, and his
right resting on his belt, for April.&nbsp; This curious font is
engraved, in outline, by James Sandly Padley, in his work
&ldquo;Selections from the Ancient Monastic, Ecclesiastical, and
Domestic Edifices of Lincolnshire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Waterlow,
1851.</p>
<p>The register dates from 1543.&nbsp; In a parish book are some
curious items between 1624 and 1629, or the early years of the
reign of Charles I.&nbsp; These shew that the parish overseers
&ldquo;held the artillery in charges,&rdquo; also the &ldquo;town
musket and knapsack.&rdquo;&nbsp; The military forces were at
that time a sort of militia, maintained by local rates, and every
parish contributed towards it, in money, arms, and
accoutrements.&nbsp; Probably these contributions were sometimes
<a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>compounded for by a lump payment, as we here find
mention of a sum being paid &ldquo;for excusing of the
town&rdquo; from its liability.&nbsp; There is also mention of
alms being given to certain persons who had been taken prisoners
&ldquo;by the Dunkirkers&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, the Dunkirk
privateers.&nbsp; This, however, must belong to a rather later
date, since the English and Dutch were in conflict at Dunkirk in
1635, and Dunkirk was taken by the French and English from the
Spaniards, and finally handed over to England, in the last year
of Cromwell&rsquo;s administration, June, 1658.</p>
<p>Mention is also made of the payment of
&ldquo;dog-whippers,&rdquo; officials who drove dogs out of the
church at the time of service.&nbsp; In some churches in Wales
the whips are still to be seen.&nbsp; Another item is the payment
of &ldquo;dyke-reeve,&rdquo; a very useful official in parishes
in, or bordering on, the fens, where inundations were only to be
avoided by keeping the &ldquo;dykes and meres&rdquo; in proper
order.</p>
<p>We are enabled to give here a list of the vicars of Stixwould
from <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1425 to the present time,
except for an interval of about 70 years, through the researches
of Mr. Gibbon, author of &ldquo;Early Lincolnshire
Wills.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thomas Lane, 1425&ndash;1440; Giles Storror,
1440&ndash;1472; John Shadworth, 1472&ndash;1482; Thomas Tymson,
1482&ndash;1485; Alexander Anyson, 1485&ndash;1502; John Aby,
1502&ndash;1520; John Robynson, 1520&ndash;1530; John Oregower,
1530.&nbsp; Down to this date, all appointments had been made by
the Lady Prioress; and there is a gap in Mr. Gibbon&rsquo;s list
till 1603.&nbsp; We are, however, able partly, if not entirely,
to fill up the gap, since we find that in 1548, Thomas Wilson,
clerk, S.T.B., was presented by Edmund Dighton, of Donington
(kinsman, doubtless, of Robert Dighton, to whom the Priory
estates were granted by Henry VIII. on the Dissolution),
&ldquo;this turn of advowson being given by the late Prioress and
convent of B.V.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Institutions to Benefices,
&ldquo;Architectural Journal,&rdquo; 1898, p. 476, No.
328).&nbsp; Also, in a List of Institutions in the 16th century,
without date, but among several others in the middle of that
century (&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; vol. vi., No. 45, p.
10), we find John Cressie, clerk, appointed by Thomas Disney, of
Carlton-in-Moreland, gentleman, by grant of the Prioress to him
and others, vacant by resignation of John Boysworth, and these
three nominations may well have embraced the 70 years.&nbsp; The
next vicar was probably Richard Travisse, who is mentioned in Mr.
Gibbon&rsquo;s list as signing, in 1603, <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>a bequest
(and therefore, we may assume, near the close of his vicariate)
of &ldquo;xl<i>s.</i>&rdquo;, the interest to be used &ldquo;for
the benefit of the poor, and church, of Stixwould.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was succeeded by Thomas Burton, buried October 21st,
1617.&nbsp; Then followed Francis Bowman, vicar in 1618; Richard
Skiggs, 1648; John Skelton, 1665: a note here states that from
1677 to 1704, being in the time of Mr. Fox, vicar, the registers
were all on loose papers, and were lost by W. Reading,
vicar.&nbsp; (This Thomas Fox was appointed by Sir John Coventry,
K.B., in 1685).&nbsp; He was succeeded by William Reading, just
named; who was followed by Anthony Baker, appointed by Lord
Anson, 1753; George Blennerhaysett (also vicar of Saxilby) was
appointed by Thomas Anson in 1767; Bernard Cracroft (also vicar
of Bardney) was the first nominee of Edmund Turnor, of Panton, in
1778; William Mounsey, 1802; Washbourn Uvedale, 1832, who died
within the year; William Gurdon Moore, 1833; John Francis Wray,
1839; John Woodlands Watkin, 1852; William Lush, 1870; William
Bennett, 1881; J. A. Penny, 1888; A. R. Wilson, 1896; James Bryan
Turner, 1901.</p>
<p>We now proceed to treat of the Halstead Hall estate, in this
parish, formerly a distinct lordship.&nbsp; The earliest mention
we can find of this as a separate manor, is in the 13th century,
a deed of that period naming Roger, son of Roger de Stixwould,
and Sir Theobald de Stykeswald, knight: this Theobald also
witnessed a deed as &ldquo;Dominus Theobaldus de Halstead,&rdquo;
May 22nd, 1281.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; 1897, p.
82).&nbsp; Their grandfather would appear to have been the Roger
de Stixwould who, with Gerard de Camvill, was sheriff of Lincoln
<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1190, and again
1192&ndash;1193.&nbsp; In the survey of the county, made between
1114 and 1118, Ralph de Stixwould is named as holding 1 carucate
and 4 oxgangs (180 acres) in Edlington, under Ranulph de Meschin,
Earl of Lincoln, son of the second Lady Lucia, already referred
to.&nbsp; We may therefore infer that these four generations, at
that early period, resided at Halstead, being designated
indifferently &ldquo;de Stikeswald&rdquo; or &ldquo;de
Halstead.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have then to pass over an interval of
more than 180 years, when, in 1465, a Richard Welby, of Moulton,
names Halstead in his will as part of his property.&nbsp; He was
sheriff in 1471, and M.P., 1472.&nbsp; We find a Chancery
Inquisition (18 Henry VII., No. 96) held at Spalding, 24 April,
1503, whereby it was shown <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>that Thomas Welby, who was sheriff
in 1492, died October 16, 1497, seised of the manors of Moulton,
Freeston, Sutton, Farlesthorpe, and Halstead, besides lands in
several other parishes.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Architectural S.
Journal,&rdquo; 1895, p. 18).</p>
<p>His will was dated Dec. 9, 1493; the executors being Sir
Edward Borough, knt., Sir G. Tailbois, knt. (a name, as we have
seen, already connected with this parish), and others.</p>
<p>He was succeeded in these possessions by his son and heir,
another Thomas Welby.&nbsp; In 1586, Vincent Welby, &ldquo;of
Hawstead&rdquo; Esq., is mentioned, along with Thomas Dighton, of
Waddingworth (another name already mentioned in connection with
Stixwould), Sir E. Dymmock, Sir G. Heneage, etc., as contributing
&ldquo;horses and lances&rdquo; for the defence of the country
against the Spanish Armada.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Architect. S.
Journal,&rdquo; 1894, p. 213).&nbsp; This Vincent Welby was son
of the above, second, Thomas Welby, <a name="citation202"></a><a
href="#footnote202" class="citation">[202]</a> by Dorothy,
daughter of Vincent Grantham, of Goltho, near Wragby, and of St.
Martin&rsquo;s Lincoln; a name still surviving in good position
in the county.&nbsp; Vincent Welby also subscribed, in 1589,
&pound;25 towards the loan for the defence of the country, along
with his neighbours, Robert Phillips, of Wispington, Robt.
Smithe, of Horsington, Willm. Heneage, of Benington, and
others.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; vol. ii., p.
133).</p>
<p>In 1561, March 21st, Richard Welby, of Halstead, was granted
the crest of &ldquo;an arm armed, the hand charnell (<i>i.e.</i>,
flesh-coloured or &lsquo;proper&rsquo;) yssving out of a cloud,
azure, in a flame of fire,&rdquo; the arms are &ldquo;sable a
fess, between three fleur de lys, argent,&rdquo; with six
quarterings.&nbsp; This coat of arms is said to have been
formerly over a mantelpiece in Halstead Hall, but was removed,
several years ago, to Denton Hall.&nbsp; In the year 1561, this
Richard Welby, of Halstead, was Sheriff of Lincoln.&nbsp; There
are many entries of the Welbys in the parish registers of
Stixwould; the last of these occurs in 1598.</p>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>The
next who owned, and resided at Halstead, was Richard Evington,
who was buried at Stixwould.&nbsp; By his will, dated 22nd
January, 1612, he left his lands in Edlington and other places to
his two sons, Maurice and Nicholas, and bequeathed the sum of
&pound;4 10<i>s</i>. &ldquo;yearlie, at the discretion of my
executors, to the poore of Stixwolde, on the 25th March, and 29th
Sept.&rdquo;&nbsp; This family did not, apparently, long remain
at Halstead, since we find entries in the Register of the death
of this Richard, 10 March, 1610; and the baptism of Maurice, son
of Nicholas Evington, 2 Nov., 1611; and we hear no more of them,
another family succeeding, of whom there are the following
mentions in the register:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. George Townshend
Esq<sup>r</sup>. died att Halstead and was buried att
Waddingworth on Wednsdaie <i>night</i> the 13<sup>th</sup> of
Februarie 1627,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Kirkland Snawden [note the
local pronunciation for Snowden] and Mrs. Townsend married the
25<sup>th</sup> of December being Christmas daie 1628.&rdquo; <a
name="citation203"></a><a href="#footnote203"
class="citation">[203]</a>&nbsp; No reason is assigned for the
somewhat unusual burial by night (though still occasionally
practised), but he was probably a Papist, not entitled to burial
in a Protestant churchyard.&nbsp; Notice is specially drawn to
the second entry, by a hand with finger extended towards it,
sketched in the margin, implying probably some covert
allusion.&nbsp; This Kirkland Snowden was a grandson of the
Bishop of Carlisle, his father, the Bishop&rsquo;s son, being
Vicar of Horncastle, the rectorship being vested in the Bishop of
Carlisle, who had a residence in Horncastle at that time, at the
back of the premises now occupied by Messrs. Lunn and
Dodson.&nbsp; Mr. George Townshend belonged to the Norfolk family
of that name, and left his Manor of Cranworth in that county to
his eldest son Thomas.&nbsp; This Kirkland Snowden is elsewhere
named Rutland Snowden.&nbsp; Their eldest son, Robert, had a
daughter Jane, who married Charles Dymoke of Scrivelsby, and
their eldest daughter Abigail, married Edward Dymoke, younger son
of Sir Edward Dymoke, 18 July, 1654, and was ancestress of the
Tetford branch of the Dymokes, now also (1904) of Scrivelsby.</p>
<p>After this the Gibbon family lived at Halstead, coming from
Tealby, and are supposed to have owned it, the baptism of
&ldquo;John Gibon&rdquo; being registered in 1666.&nbsp; Another
owner of Halstead was Sir John Coventry, Bart., <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>who as
before stated, presented to the benefice of Stixwould in
1685.&nbsp; His sister married the 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, who
is said to have been entertained more than once with a large
retinue at Halstead.&nbsp; Sir John was the subject of various
attacks, for using offensive language concerning his eccentric
Sovereign, Charles II, asking in Parliament &ldquo;whether the
King&rsquo;s pleasure lay in the men, or women players&rdquo; at
the theatres; in consequence of which &ldquo;The Coventry
Act&rdquo; was passed in 1671, making it felony to maim or
disfigure a person, and declaring the Sovereign incompetent to
pardon such offenders.&nbsp; Halstead, subsequently, became the
property of Sir William Kyte, or Keate; then of Lord Anson, and
his son Thomas Anson, who presented to the benefice in 1767, and
it was in 1778, bought by Edmund Turnor, Esq., of Stoke
Rochford.&nbsp; Having been the residence of these various owners
of wealth and position, we can hardly doubt that Halstead Hall
was formerly much larger then it is at present, and there still
remains, as a part of the farm buildings, a lofty structure with
stone-framed windows; the walls being of brick, smaller than
those of modern times, and relieved by diamond-shaped patterns of
black bricks, indicating a care and taste in the style of
erection, which would hardly have been bestowed upon a mere
barn.&nbsp; It probably dates from the 15th century. <a
name="citation204"></a><a href="#footnote204"
class="citation">[204]</a>&nbsp; The present Hall, probably
erected in the 16th century, is a two-storeyed structure; the
rooms not large, but lofty, their height on the ground floor
being over 10ft, and on the upper floor more than 13ft, with
spacious attics above, for stores; the walls are very
substantial, being 2&frac12;ft. thick; while the windows, with
their massive mullions of Ancaster stone, would indicate a much
larger building; and foundations of further buildings have, from
time to time, been discovered.</p>
<p>In recent times Halstead Hall has been chiefly remarkable for
the great robbery, which occurred there on February 2nd, 1829,
the details of which are so peculiar that we give them
here.&nbsp; The Hall was at that time occupied by the farming
tenant, Mr. Wm. Elsey, his wife, and servants.&nbsp; At 8
o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when the servant <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>men went
out to &ldquo;supper-up&rdquo; the horses, they were attacked by
seven or eight men, thrown down, their legs tied, and their hands
secured behind their backs, and each was left in a separate stall
of the stable.&nbsp; The stable door was then locked, and one of
the gang was stationed outside to keep watch.&nbsp; The thieves
then went to the Hall, and knocked at the back door.&nbsp; One of
the servant girls asked who was there; when the answer was given,
&ldquo;Open the door, Betsy.&rdquo;&nbsp; She did so; when four
or five men rushed into the kitchen.&nbsp; One of the maids
escaped, and ran to the room where her master and mistress were
sitting.&nbsp; Mr. Elsey was smoking his pipe; Mrs. Elsey
preparing something for supper.&nbsp; She saved the silver spoon,
which she was using, by slipping it into her bosom.&nbsp; Mr.
Elsey seized the poker to defend himself; but, on seeing their
number, he prudently laid it down.&nbsp; They then rifled his
pockets, took his watch and money; also making Mrs. Elsey empty
her pockets.&nbsp; They then obliged the two to go into a large
closet, locked the door, and tied a hayfork across it.&nbsp; They
then collected what plate they could find, to the value of about
&pound;30, and &pound;50 in cash; taking also all the silk
handkerchiefs they could find.&nbsp; They then ransacked the
property, and made a hearty meal.&nbsp; Mrs. Elsey, in her
confinement close by, complained to them that she was very cold,
and begged them to let her out to get to the fire.&nbsp;
Accordingly, one of them brought her out to the fire; but seeing
that she was noticing them, he ordered her to go into the closet
again, giving her some of the overcoats, which were hanging in
the passage near.&nbsp; When they had got all they wanted, they
compelled Mr. Elsey to go upstairs, one walking before him, and
another behind, each holding a pistol.&nbsp; They then obliged
Mrs. Elsey to follow him.&nbsp; Having locked up the two once
more in the closet, the marauders went off with their plunder,
wishing them good night, and saying that, if any alarm was given,
they would return to retaliate.&nbsp; About two hours afterwards,
Mr. Elsey, with the aid of a knife and small hammer, succeeded in
making a hole through the brick wall of the closet, through which
one of the maids was able to thrust her arm and set them at
liberty.&nbsp; The only article recovered was a plated coffee-pot
found in Halstead wood, which the thieves had thrown away.&nbsp;
The footpath, outside this wood, passes near a farmhouse, and the
farmer named Sleight, heard the voices of the <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>thieves as
they went by in the night; and some of them were found drunk by
the roadside next morning.&nbsp; An old woman still alive (1904),
and aged 93, has told the writer that she remembers this robbery
well; that two of the robbers were hanged together at Lincoln,
with a sheep-stealer &ldquo;Bill Clarke,&rdquo; the last time
that offence was punished by hanging; these two were known as
&ldquo;Lister,&rdquo; (others say &ldquo;Tippler,&rdquo;) and
&ldquo;Tiger Tom&rdquo;; <a name="citation206a"></a><a
href="#footnote206a" class="citation">[206a]</a> the latter was a
desperate character, and it was thought that no one would take
him; but two men, powerfully built and fearless, David English of
Hameringham, and a keeper named Bullivant, were set to the task,
and they succeeded in running their men down at &ldquo;The
Bungalow,&rdquo; a small public house on the bank of the Witham
at Boston. <a name="citation206b"></a><a href="#footnote206b"
class="citation">[206b]</a>&nbsp; Of the last hanged it is said,
that he was such a bad character, that his own mother foretold
that he would &ldquo;die in his shoes,&rdquo; and that, on the
scaffold, he shook off his shoes, in order to falsify her
prediction.&nbsp; One of them, who was transported for life,
leagued with two other criminals on board the same vessel, and
the three were caught in the act of attempting to scuttle the
ship, and were afterwards thrown overboard.&nbsp; As a tinge of
romance not uncommonly has attended daring exploits of this
character, it was remarked at the time that Italian banditti
could hardly have planned the robbery more cleverly, or carried
it out with more deliberate courage.&nbsp; Some mystery seemed to
hang about the apparent leader of the party, whose <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>demeanour
was said to be above that of his temporary position; and one of
them, Timothy Brammar, was exalted into a hero, by being
celebrated in a ballad.</p>
<p>There are some rather singular field-names in this parish; as
&ldquo;Bull-pingle,&rdquo; to the east, one field from the road
to Horsington; &ldquo;pingle&rdquo; being a Lincolnshire word for
a small inclosure (Brogden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Provincial
Words.&rdquo;)&nbsp; &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Parlour&rdquo; is a
triangular field, abutting on &ldquo;The Monk&rsquo;s
Drain,&rdquo; adjoining the Bull-pingle.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Coulter
Cast&rdquo; adjoins Poolham Ings; it is a narrow strip, probably
difficult to plough; hence the names adjoining this, are the
&ldquo;High&rdquo; and &ldquo;Low&rdquo; &ldquo;Priest&rsquo;s
Fields.&rdquo;&nbsp; All these fields are in the Halstead
manor.&nbsp; In Stixwould proper, is &ldquo;The Field,&rdquo;
<i>par excellence</i>, probably one of the earliest clearings,
and so named to distinguish it from the &ldquo;Wood,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Would,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Field,&rdquo; was where the trees
had been &ldquo;felled;&rdquo; then there are the &ldquo;Warren
Field,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sykes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hemp-yard,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Town Close,&rdquo; probably where the villeins had
right of common pastures.&nbsp; &ldquo;Coney-Green,&rdquo; like
the &ldquo;Warren Field,&rdquo; has a reference to the rabbits,
being the term used in Norman law, for warren, although in some
cases, like the &ldquo;Coney-Garth,&rdquo; at Bardney, or
&ldquo;Coney-Green,&rdquo; at Edlington, it means, probably, the
&ldquo;King&rsquo;s Enclosure.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such names as
&ldquo;Steer Piece,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ewes Walk,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sheep-cote Lane&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, Sheep Bank Lane,) and
&ldquo;Cow Legs,&rdquo; speak for themselves.&nbsp; There is also
the &ldquo;Mill Field,&rdquo; although there is no tradition of a
mill having existed; possibly there may have been a mill in
connection with the drainage.&nbsp; At the junction of the three
roads, east of the village, the Roman &ldquo;Trivium,&rdquo;
formerly stood, what to the rustic offender was no
&ldquo;trivial&rdquo; matter, the village stocks, doubtless with
the usually concomitant &ldquo;whipping post.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
stood on what was called &ldquo;The Town Mound,&rdquo; which was
levelled about the middle of the last century, and is now only
represented by a triangular plot of sward.</p>
<p>Near the Witham, in a field south of the road to the ferry,
the Rev. J. A. Penny, late vicar, found fragments of
medi&aelig;val pottery, pieces of &ldquo;puzzle jugs,&rdquo; the
neck of a &ldquo;pilgrim&rsquo;s bottle,&rdquo; &amp;c., all of
which the late Sir Augustus Franks, of the British Museum,
pronounced to be Cistercian ware, being only found where
Cistercian houses have existed.</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>In
the church of St. Andrew, Woodhall Spa, is a sepulchral stone,
having a rather rudely-carved effigy of a lady, in the attitude
of prayer, holding a book between her hands.&nbsp; This now
supports the credence table, but it was taken from Stixwould
priory, and is commonly supposed to have represented the Lady
Prioress, or the Lady Lucia, the foundress; the latter, however,
was buried at Spalding, and would therefore hardly have an effigy
at Stixwould.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Stourton</span>.</h3>
<p>Stourton, called Stourton Magna, or Great Stourton, to
distinguish it from Stourton Parva, the hamlet included in
Baumber, is rather more than a mile, northward, beyond Baumber,
and five miles from Horncastle.&nbsp; This was formerly the
property, a sheep-walk, of the Premonstratensian Abbey of St.
Mary, of Tupholme, founded by Robert de Nova Villa or Nevill, in
the twentieth year of Henry III. (&ldquo;Liber Regis,&rdquo;
Bacon&rsquo;s ed. 1786, p. 424).&nbsp; Dugdale states that he
held the lands of the king <i>in capite</i>, from the time of the
Conquest, with which he endowed that monastery.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Monasticon,&rdquo; vol. ii., 596.)&nbsp; Land in this
parish was also granted by the Conqueror, to Eudo, son of
Spirewick, the founder of the Tattershall family.&nbsp; He held
five carucates, or about six hundred acres, beside a mill, and
190 acres of meadow.&nbsp; The powerful Bishop of Durham, William
de Karilepho, who was Lord Chief Justice under the Conqueror, had
also a grant of land in this parish, as also had Odo, Bishop of
Baieaux, and his vassal, Ilbert, occupied one carucate, or 120
acres, with villeins, bordars, and socmen under him, occupying
480 more acres.&nbsp; The Saxon thane Grinchel also had here 360
acres, valued in King Edward&rsquo;s time at 40<i>s.</i></p>
<p>In the reign of Henry VIII. the family of Dighton, though of
mercantile origin at Lincoln, ancestors having been mayors and
sheriffs of that city, were landed proprietors in this
neighbourhood, one of them, Thomas, residing at Waddingworth; but
the head of the family was Robert Dighton, of Stourton Magna, he
married Joyce, daughter and heiress of William St. Paul, of
Snarford, which family became extinct on the death of Sir George
St. Paul, Bart., in 1613.&nbsp; Robert of Stourton, along with <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>members of
the Heneage, Dymoke, Monson, Hussey, and very many other leading
county families, took part in the Lincolnshire rising, to protest
against the dissolution of the monasteries.&nbsp; A daughter of
Thomas Dighton, of Stourton, married Edward Clinton, of Baumber,
who subsequently became Earl of Lincoln. <a
name="citation209"></a><a href="#footnote209"
class="citation">[209]</a>&nbsp; The residence of the Dightons,
traces of which still remain in the moats and mounds, was
situated on land now belonging to W. H. Trafford, Esq., in what
is now a grass field, about a mile to the west of the present
Stourton Hall park and plantations, lying between the road, on
the north, from Stourton Magna to Minting and Bardney, and, on
the south, the main Baumber, or Horncastle and Lincoln, old Roman
highway.&nbsp; It must have been a building of some considerable
size; the moat, which enclosed nearly a square, the sides, just
under 100 yards long, is distinctly traceable, the whole of the
surface of the inclosure is covered with mounds or depressions;
there is an apparent opening in the middle of the south-western
side, and outside, to the south, are traces of a large stew-pond,
E-shaped, in length thirty-six yards, by thirty broad, with a
small pond, or reservoir behind it.&nbsp; A modern drain has been
made on this south-west side, probably to draw the water off the
moat, as these moats and ponds were periodically cleaned
out.&nbsp; A footpath, forming a short cut between the
above-named two roads, passes east of these remains, so that they
can be easily approached and inspected.&nbsp; This path branches
off from the Horncastle and Lincoln high road, at a gate nearly
opposite some cottages named the &ldquo;Hungrum
Houses&rdquo;.&nbsp; Sturton is believed to have been a Roman
station.&nbsp; It is close to the old road from Horncastle to
Caistor, both Roman towns.</p>
<p>The church, dedicated to All Saints, although a heterogeneous
mixture of a variety of styles, and for many years in a
dilapidated condition, has some very interesting features.&nbsp;
The vicar, the Rev. F. M. Blakiston, following up the efforts of
his predecessor, the Rev. E. B. Bland, is now (1904) raising
money to restore the fabric, and with Mr. J. T. Micklethwaite, as
architect, the result will doubtless be a creditable
structure.&nbsp; The cost of complete renovation is estimated at
close upon &pound;2,000, so that the <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>work may probably have to extend
over some years.&nbsp; Although the aspect of the church has been
one of ruin and desolation, there are traces of the work of seven
centuries.&nbsp; Domesday Book mentions a church as existing in
Saxon times, but of that, nothing remains.&nbsp; The oldest parts
of the present fabric belong to the 12th century.&nbsp; At that
time the nave was two-thirds of its present length, and the
chancel was narrower.&nbsp; In the 13th century a north aisle,
with two arches, and probably a tower, with a third and larger
north arch, were added.&nbsp; In the 14th century a new chancel
was built, wider and probably longer.&nbsp; Then followed a
period of neglect and varied vicissitudes.&nbsp; In the 17th
century the chancel was shortened, and the present east wall cuts
away part of an eastern sepulchre, in the north chancel
wall.&nbsp; The north aisle was taken down probably about this
period.&nbsp; The upper part of the tower was removed, probably
early in the 19th century, as the bells, three in number, are
said to have been sold in 1810.&nbsp; The stones of the tower and
aisle were used for building two sides of the churchyard
wall.&nbsp; Nothing now remains of the tower, except the string
course at the top of the truncated basement, <a
name="citation210"></a><a href="#footnote210"
class="citation">[210]</a> which now forms part of the
nave.&nbsp; There are still stones of a Norman arch in the south
wall at the back of the modern porch.&nbsp; An original window,
small and much dilapidated, remains in the north wall of the
chancel, a larger one having been bricked up.&nbsp; There is a
priest&rsquo;s door in the south wall.&nbsp; The westernmost
window in the south wall of the nave is a relic of the 14th
century, the renovation, being of floriated style, with two
lights.&nbsp; In the floor of what was the tower are portions of
stone, from the windows of the former aisle, much broken.&nbsp;
The rest is modern, as is also the roof of the nave.&nbsp; What
is now used as a font is really an old mortar, the old font in
Perpendicular style having been, it is said, sold about 40 years
ago, and removed to the garden of a <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>farmhouse in the adjoining parish of
Edlington, where it still remains.&nbsp; The furniture of the
church is of the 18th century, or later, but there is a good old
oak chest.&nbsp; On the western portion of the north wall is a
curious fresco, not probably of very ancient date, consisting of
a skeleton, and a winged figure rising from a sepulchral
monument, which bears an inscription, mostly illegible,
&ldquo;Redeem the time, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chancel arch,
now almost ruinous, is part of the original building; south of
it, is a tablet, in memory of &ldquo;William Settle, Clerk, who
departed this life, July 4, 1848, born at Urswick, in the County
of Lancaster, graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge, aged 82,
and 52 years vicar of this parish.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Settles have
a burial vault in the churchyard.&nbsp; The register dates from
1679.&nbsp; The name of William Vaux appears as vicar, from 1690
to 1719.&nbsp; One entry is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Margaret
Vaux the 21st child of William Vaux and Elizabeth his wife was
baptized y<sup>e</sup> 23 of October 1718,&rdquo; and shortly
after, follows, in a different hand, &ldquo;Mr. William Vaux,
vicar, buryed May ye 30, 1719.&rdquo;&nbsp; The family would seem
to have continued to reside in the parish, for we find recorded
the burial of Mary Vaux, February 19, 1720; that of Margaret
Vaux, September 3rd, 1721; and that of Elizabeth Vaux,
&ldquo;January ye 10, 1755.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of the rest of the
numerous progeny of this fruitful couple no traces remain.</p>
<p>A small hamlet in this parish is named Lowthorpe, probably
from its position; while a farm, belonging to Mr. Robert
Harrison, of Horncastle, who is Lay-Rector, is named
&ldquo;Sturton Stoup&rdquo; farm.&nbsp; This name, however, has
no connection with the &ldquo;Stoup,&rdquo; or holy-water vessel
of the church; but &ldquo;Stoup&rdquo; is a Lincolnshire word,
meaning a post, or stake.&nbsp; The farmhouse was, within recent
years, a wayside inn, called &ldquo;The Stoup&rdquo;; and the
&ldquo;stoup&rdquo; was a post, or stake, planted in the middle
of an adjoining green lane to prevent its being used as a
thoroughfare.&nbsp; The parish was inclosed in 1778.</p>
<p>The benefice of Stourton was formerly in the patronage of the
Crown, and there was a Vicarage house, standing in its own
grounds, in what is now an open field, south of the
churchyard.&nbsp; This was demolished many years ago.&nbsp; The
Vicarage was united to that of Baumber, in the patronage of the
Duke of Newcastle, about the year 1870, the consolidated
benefices being now in the gift of the Lord <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>Chancellor.&nbsp; They had, however, been held together
by at least three previous incumbents.&nbsp; The communion plate
is old, although only the chalice bears a date, 1648.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Tetford</span>.</h3>
<p>Tetford, which adjoins Belchford, lies to the north-east of
Horncastle, at a distance of about 7 miles; though a village with
a population under 500, it almost aspires to the rank of a small
town, as it possesses more than one street; has several shops,
and a number of fair residences.&nbsp; Letters <i>via</i>
Horncastle, arrive at 10 a.m.&nbsp; At the date of Domesday Book,
it was one of the limited number of parishes which then possessed
a church.&nbsp; Saxon thanes, by name Elmer, Arnwi and Britrod,
held lands here.&nbsp; Thomas, Archbishop of York, formerly a
Canon of Baieux, in Normandy, and one of the Conqueror&rsquo;s
Chaplains, received a grant of land here from his Sovereign; and
we find his vassal, Gilbert, occupying under him two carucates
with eight villeins and seven socmen, who had two more carucates
(240 acres) among them.&nbsp; The Norman Gozelin, son of Lanbert,
also held land here, which was occupied by his vassal, Walter,
with five socmen, and three villeins.&nbsp; At a later date (13th
century) the family of De Hesele were proprietors in Tetford, and
benefactors to the church, also presenting to the benefice of
Somersby, as well as to that of Tetford (&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp;
Q.&rdquo; 1894&ndash;5, pp. 228&ndash;29).&nbsp; Then we find the
Cormayles family holding lands here, and presenting to
Somersby.&nbsp; The Crevequers, and the Brayboeufs had the
presentation to a chapelry here, of St. Bartholomew, besides
owning land.&nbsp; After them followed the Barkworths, and to
them succeeded the Thimbelbies.&nbsp; In the Court of
Ward&rsquo;s Inquisitions (3, 4, and 5, Edwd. VI., vol. v., 91)
we find Matthew Thimbleby, who married Anne, daughter of Sir
Robert Hussey, about 1521, seised of the advowsons of Tetford and
Somersby; and his widow married Sir Robert Savile, Knt., who
(through her apparently) was seised (according to Chancery
Inquisition, post mort., 28 Eliz., 1st part, No. 116) of the
manors of Tetford, Somersby, and several others.&nbsp; Sir Robert
disposed of some of the property thus acquired, selling Tetford
to George Anton, Esq., through whose <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>daughter Elizabeth, married to Sir
Edward Hussey, the property passed to the Hussey family, whose
head, Lord Hussey, of Sleaford, for his treachery at the time of
the Lincolnshire Rebellion, was attainted and executed, by Henry
VIII.&nbsp; A widow, Elizabeth Hussey, presented to the benefice
as late as 1690.&nbsp; For many years a branch of the Dymoke
family were located at Tetford, until, under the will of the late
Lionel Dymoke, they succeeded to the Scrivelsby property, and
removed to Scrivelsby Court.&nbsp; Sir Hugh A. H. Cholmeley is
now lord of the manor, but the principal landowners are Meaburn
Staniland, Esq., F. S. Dymoke, Esq., the executors of George
Westerby, and many small freeholders.&nbsp; There was formerly a
Tetford Literary Club, having as its members most of the gentry
of the neighbourhood; one of whom, Langhorne Burton, of Somersby,
celebrated the association in an amusing poem, of some 200 lines,
published in 1772.&nbsp; It is given in Weir&rsquo;s History, of
date 1828.&nbsp; Dr. Samuel Johnson attended the meetings of this
club, when visiting the Langtons of Langton Hall; and he is said
to have played skittles at the White Hart Inn, in Tetford.&nbsp;
There are traces of an ancient encampment in this parish,
probably the scene of struggles between Britons and Saxons.&nbsp;
It lies between the two main streets, to the south, and on one
side is skirted by a beck which forms one of the feeders of the
Somersby stream, sung of by Tennyson as &ldquo;The
Brook.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, Leland (&ldquo;Collectanea,&rdquo; vol.
i., pt. 2., p. 509) states that Horsa, brother of Hengist, the
Saxon General, was defeated by the Britons, under Raengeires; and
the name, like that of Belchford, would seem to be of British
origin; &ldquo;Tat&rdquo; being a Druid deity, and
&ldquo;fford&rdquo; meaning a road.</p>
<p>The church, dedicated to St. Mary, is a structure of Spilsby
sandstone, of some considerable antiquity, and of larger
proportions than most of those in the immediate
neighbourhood.&nbsp; For many years it has been in a sadly
neglected condition, although of late it has been somewhat
improved.&nbsp; It is capable of being made an edifice fully
worthy of divine worship.&nbsp; The Puritan square pews survive
for the most part; and a western gallery, or singing loft, now
disused.&nbsp; The nave has north and south aisles of three bays,
and a clerestory above.&nbsp; These, with the tower, are in the
Perpendicular style; the south aisle has some Decorated features;
and a lancet window in its <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>west end, in which a crocheted open
canopy has been introduced, tells of a still earlier
church.&nbsp; The north aisle was rebuilt on the old foundations
in 1826.&nbsp; The chancel arch has a continuous moulding,
without capitals.&nbsp; A closed arch in the north chancel walls
shews a former chantry on that side.&nbsp; The east window is
modern.&nbsp; There are traces in the south aisle indicating a
former chantry altar.&nbsp; The font is a plain octagon, the
basin relieved by foliage at each angle.&nbsp; On the south wall
of the nave is a monument to Captain Edward Dymoke, cousin to
Champion Lewis Dymoke, who died 1739; with breastplate and helmet
suspended above.&nbsp; There are three other Dymoke tablets; and
one to J. Emeris, Fellow of Corpus x<sup>sti</sup>. College,
Rector, and Head Master of Louth Grammar School.&nbsp; The tower
is massive, somewhat low, though well-proportioned.&nbsp; It has
small corner pinnacles, and immense gurgoyles.&nbsp; On the right
of the doorway, within the west porch, is a stoup, rising from a
stone bench.&nbsp; There are three bells; one weighs 1 ton, 1
cwt., 3 qrs., 7 lbs., and has the inscription &ldquo;Sancta
Maria, ora pro nobis&rdquo;; the second bell weighs 16&frac12;
cwts.; the third weighs 11 cwts., cast at Barton, by
Harrison.&nbsp; The Sanctus bell stands on the floor.&nbsp; One
of these bells is said to have formerly belonged to the church at
Fulletby, when there was a larger fabric there than at
present.&nbsp; In 1887 a Jubilee clock was put up, by
subscription, made by Messrs. Maddison and Blythe, of
Horncastle.&nbsp; In 1903 the present rector, the Rev. W. Wood,
inaugurated, by a bazaar, a scheme for the much needed
restoration of this church, in which, it is to be hoped, he may
be successful.</p>
<p>On the south side of the church is the base, and part of the
shaft, of a churchyard cross.&nbsp; Upon the former, several
shields are cut; one of these, within a quatrefoil panel, bears
three bars in pale, four mullets bendwise; and upon another is
the same bearing, impaling a cinquefoil, between 6 crosses
plain.&nbsp; These were the Thimbleby bearings.</p>
<p>Tetford has been the scene of traditionary witchcraft, the
following anecdote having been related by a quondam inhabitant,
whose widow still survives.&nbsp; It has some resemblance to the
story of the phantom hare at Bolingbroke Castle.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there lived in Tetford an old woman
possessed of magical powers.&nbsp; It was said that she could
assume the form of a hare, and, emerging from her cottage <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>through the
&ldquo;cat hole&rdquo; in the door, could roam the country round
at will.&nbsp; She had a son who was given to poaching.&nbsp; The
events on a particular occasion are recorded as follows:
&ldquo;Two men are walking on the road from Somersby to Tetford
in the evening; one carries a gun.&nbsp; Just in front a hare
passes through the hedge, and comes into the road.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bang at her, Jack,&rdquo; says Joe.&nbsp; Jack puts gun to
shoulder, and aims, but for some reason, does not fire.&nbsp; He
lowers his gun, then tries again, but with the same result.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dal it, Joe,&rdquo; says Jack, &ldquo;I cannot; summat
stops me.&nbsp; Tack thou the gun!&rdquo;&nbsp; Joe seizes the
gun, but the hare is, by this time, nearly out of shot.&nbsp;
However, he fires, and exclaims, &ldquo;Its noa goa, she&rsquo;s
hit i&rsquo; the leg, but it woant stop her.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
quicken their steps, lest the shot might have attracted a
keeper.&nbsp; Jack goes to the cottage where his mother lives,
while Joe goes to his home further down the
&ldquo;street.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jack goes to the pantry and empties a
very roomy pocket, inside his fustian coat, of its contents, we
will not say what.&nbsp; He brings out a mug of ale, and sits
down by the fire, to enjoy it.&nbsp; His mother is sitting on the
other side of the fire, rather doubled up in her chair, and with
a look of pain on her wrinkled face, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up
Mother?&rdquo; asks Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a bad pain
i&rsquo; my leg,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;it came on all of a
sudden, a few minutes ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rub it wi&rsquo;
some o&rsquo; them oils ye&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; says Jack;
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hev supper, and then ye&rsquo;d better goa to
bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hed my supper,&rdquo; she
says, &ldquo;ye were so long o&rsquo; coming, that I did&rsquo;nt
wait o&rsquo; ye, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll goa to bed
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gets up with difficulty, hobbles across the
room, and slowly mounts the &ldquo;lether&rdquo; (ladder) to her
bedroom.&nbsp; Jack gets his supper, and then goes out to the
ale-house not far off, for a final pot, and chat, before
&ldquo;turning in.&rdquo;&nbsp; There he meets Joe, and they have
a pipe together.&nbsp; In the course of conversation Jack says,
&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s bad i&rsquo; the leg, she was ta&rsquo;en
all of a sudden a little afore I comed hoam.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joe
laughs, and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d upode it, she&rsquo;s
bewitched hersen, instead of some un else.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next
morning the old woman does not get up.&nbsp; She calls to Jack,
he goes to her, &ldquo;My leg is worser, gie me some tea, and
then goa to the wise man at the town an&rsquo; ask him
what&rsquo;s the matter wi&rsquo; me, for I feel that
queer.&nbsp; Get my stocking out o&rsquo; yon chest, and
I&rsquo;ll gie thee a crown to gie him for his fee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
To be brief, Jack attends to her wants, gets his breakfast, and
walks off some miles to the <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>neighbouring town.&nbsp; There he
has a jug of ale, to refresh him after his walk, and so goes to
the wise man.&nbsp; He finds him at home, and tells his
errand.&nbsp; The wise man takes him into a back room, tells him
to sit down, while he lays out a big book on the table, and opens
it at random.&nbsp; Jack cannot read, but he would not be any
wiser in this case, if he could, for the page is covered with
curious characters, which none but the wise man can read, and a
sceptic might suggest that he cannot either.&nbsp; The latter
then turns to a cupboard in the corner of the room, opens the
door of it, put his head inside, and <i>sotto voce</i>, mumbles
something.&nbsp; Having done this for a moment or two, as if
conversing with some &ldquo;familiar spirit&rdquo; in an unknown
tongue, he throws the cupboard door wide open, whereupon out
flies a large &ldquo;bumble-bee,&rdquo; which circles, buzzing,
round the room, and at length settles on the open book.&nbsp; The
wise man examines the particular letters, or characters, on which
the bee has settled.&nbsp; Having studied them carefully, he says
to Jack, &ldquo;When did your mother first feel the
pain?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; says Jack,&rdquo;
afore I came home to supper.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When did you
shoot that hare?&rdquo; asks the wise man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not
shoot a hare at all,&rdquo; replied Jack.&nbsp; The wise man
consults the characters again, and then says &ldquo;No!&nbsp; I
see you did not, but it was your gun that shot her.&rdquo;&nbsp;
At this Jack is astonished, and tells the whole
particulars.&nbsp; The wise man says, &ldquo;your good spirit
kept you from shooting, because she was your own mother, but your
mate shot her with your own gun.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know that
your mother&rsquo;s a witch, and goes out as a hare whenever she
likes?&nbsp; Why, I heard of her running across the road in front
of a team of horses, in her form of a hare and they were so
scared that they nearly dragged the waggon into a dyke.&nbsp;
However,&rdquo; he adds,&rdquo; she&rsquo;ll soon be well
again.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the remedy: Catch a hedgehog, take a
comb, and with it saw off one of its legs, and tell her to rub
her leg well with the hedgehog&rsquo;s leg, and the pain will
soon go.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jack journeyed home in high spirits, taking
a pot or two on the way, by way of self-congratulation; and my
informant deponeth that all came about as the wise man
foretold.</p>
<p>Outside the boundary of Tetford, to the west, and strictly
speaking in the parish of Salmonby, a number of flint arrow-heads
have been found on Warlow farm, near a spot named &ldquo;Warlow
Camp.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are of a trilobite <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>form,
finely chipped, and about one inch in length, three-quarters of
an inch broad at base.&nbsp; They belong to the neolithic period;
and from the very crisp character of the chipping, it is evident
that they have not been used; there was probably a factory of
such implements on the spot.&nbsp; Several specimens may be seen
at the house of Mr. Westerby, tenant of the farm.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Waddingworth</span>.</h3>
<p>Waddingworth is a small village, about 6 miles from
Horncastle, in a north-westerly direction, between Gautby and
Wispington.&nbsp; The church, dedicated to St. Margaret, is now
in a very dilapidated condition.&nbsp; The rectory is held at the
present time (1904) by the Rev. L. Dewhurst, along with that of
Gautby, where he has a fairly commodious house, with permission
from the Bishop to hold only occasional services at Waddingworth
Church, as that at Gautby is almost equally convenient for the
people of both parishes.</p>
<p>The register dates from 1640, but entries are found in the
registers of Baumber, for this parish, from 1695 to 1779.&nbsp;
At Bardney is the nearest postal and telegraph office.&nbsp;
Letters come <i>via</i> Horncastle.&nbsp; It is altogether a very
out-of-the-way spot.</p>
<p>The antiquity of Waddingworth is probably shown in its name,
which, according to some, consists of the Saxon
&ldquo;Wodin&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Odin&rdquo;), their God of war
(which name also appears in our Wednesday, or Wodin&rsquo;s day),
and the Saxon &ldquo;worth,&rdquo; an inclosure, which also
appears in several place-names in the neighbourhood, as
Benniworth, Faldingworth, Hag-<i>worth</i>-<i>ing</i>ham.&nbsp;
The last of these names, however, suggests a derivation which I
am inclined to think more probable.&nbsp; Divide the name into
three elements, and we get wad, or &ldquo;woad,&rdquo; a plant
greatly valued by the Britons, who dyed their bodies with it (and
which name would continue through the Saxon period, as it does
still), and &ldquo;ing,&rdquo; Saxon for meadow, and
&ldquo;worth,&rdquo; Saxon for enclosure, the whole meaning an
&ldquo;enclosed field of woad&rdquo;; enclosed, doubtless,
because of the value of the woad.&nbsp; It is still a valuable
crop, and frequently mixed with the Indian
&ldquo;Indigo.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>The
earliest actual mention of Waddingworth is in Domesday Book, in
which there are two references to it.&nbsp; In one of these we
are told that the Conqueror gave part of the parish to the proud
and powerful Bishop of Durham, William de Karilepho, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1082, who was also Chief Justice of
England.&nbsp; There were 4 carucates of land, <i>i.e.</i>, 480
acres, rateable to gelt (a very small tax), the whole being 6
carucates, or 720 acres, with 20 acres of meadow
(&ldquo;ings&rdquo;) and 25 acres of underwood.&nbsp; The other
notice is that the same amount of land was given by the Conqueror
to one of his distinguished Norman soldiers, Eudo the son of
Spirewic.&nbsp; Eudo, it will be remembered, was a comrade in
arms of Pinco, the latter of whom acquired large property in the
neighbourhood of Spilsby, and his descendants eventually became
the Lords Willoughby d&rsquo; Eresby (<i>i.e.</i>,
Spilsby).&nbsp; Eudo received the manor of Tattershall and
several others, one of these being a moiety of
Waddingworth.&nbsp; He was the founder of Kirkstead Abbey, which
he richly endowed.&nbsp; This leads to a curious
coincidence.&nbsp; Dr. Oliver, the learned writer of &ldquo;The
Religious Houses on the Witham,&rdquo; mentions that among the
possessions of Tupholme Abbey were lands in Waddingworth.&nbsp;
What more natural than that, in days when spending one&rsquo;s
wealth on so-called religious works was a passport to heaven for
the giver, and for his forefathers or his descendants, Eudo
should have devoted some of his wealth to the Religious House at
Tupholme, as well as to the Religious House at Kirkstead?&nbsp;
Tupholme was founded by two brothers, Alan and Gilbert de Nevil,
in 1160, Kirkstead was founded 1139.&nbsp; At the dissolution of
the monasteries, Henry VIII. seized monastic property, and this
is why we find the King as Patron of Waddingworth in &ldquo;Liber
Regis,&rdquo; and also in much later authorities.&nbsp; It is,
indeed, now in the patronage of the Lord Chancellor, as
representing the crown.&nbsp; The Conqueror seized it by the
right of conquest; Henry VIII. seized it as the plunderer of
monasteries.&nbsp; This carries us down to nearly the middle of
the 16th century.&nbsp; There were, however, other small
proprietors who owned land, besides these two prominent
parties.&nbsp; At an early period, there is a &ldquo;Final
Concord,&rdquo; so called, or agreement, of the 13th century, as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;On October 19, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1200, Petronilla, the widow of
Richard de Waddingworth, claimed of Robert de Waddingworth,
tenant of a 3rd part, <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>viz., 20 oxgangs (or 300 acres),
with 6 tofts, in Waddingworth, besides lands in Bucknall and
Horsington, as her dower, given to her by her late husband, the
said Richard; and Robert surrendered all claim to the lands in
favour of the said Petronilla for her life, for which Petronilla
gave him 2&frac12; marks.&rdquo;&nbsp; After the dissolution of
the monasteries, though the crown retained the patronage of the
benefice, the land seems to have passed into several other
hands.&nbsp; In 1559, Roger Fulstow, of Waddingworth, claimed of
his sovereign, Queen Elizabeth, protection against the outrages
committed by the mad Earl of Lincoln, who lived at Tattershall;
and was well known for his violent proceedings towards the
Saviles of Poolham, and others. <a name="citation219a"></a><a
href="#footnote219a" class="citation">[219a]</a>&nbsp; He
(Fulstow) was afterwards sent on an embassy to the Landgrave of
Hesse.&nbsp; Macaulay, the historian, says that a Fulstow, of
Waddingworth, incurred the displeasure of Henry VIII., and was
punished, though he does not say how.&nbsp; This was probably the
same man earlier in life, and the employment of him, by
Elizabeth, shows that, having annoyed the father, he recovered
the favour of the daughter.&nbsp; But even earlier than this,
Thomas Dighton, of Waddingworth, gent. (son of Edmund Dighton,
and grandson of Robert Dighton, lord of the manor of Stourton)
was intimate with the Dymokes, and was visiting at Scrivelsby
Court at the time of the &ldquo;Lincolnshire Rising,&rdquo;
against Henry VIII. (otherwise called the Pilgrimage of Grace),
in 1536, which led to the merry monarch pronouncing his
well-known criticism on the men of Lincolnshire, that they were
&ldquo;the most beastly in all the realm.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
Dightons came of a mercantile stock in Lincoln, where they were
Mayors and Sheriffs, and amassed large fortunes.&nbsp; One of
them, Robert, of Stourton, married Joyce <a
name="citation219b"></a><a href="#footnote219b"
class="citation">[219b]</a> St. Paul (or vulgarly Sampoole),
daughter and heiress of William St. Paul of Snarford, who was
also involved in the Rising aforesaid; the chief member of the
family being Sir George St. Paul, who died childless in 1614,
when, with him, the family became extinct.&nbsp; <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>In the
lists of those gentry who contributed to the defence of the
country, when the Spanish Armada was expected, are the names of
G. St. Paul, who contributed &ldquo;1 lance, and 2 light
horse&rdquo;; while Thomas Dighton, of Waddingworth, of that day,
contributed also 1 lance, and 1 light horse.&nbsp; In the year
1546, Robert Hoberthorn, a native of Waddingworth, became Lord
Mayor of London (&ldquo;Weir&rsquo;s History,&rdquo; vol. i., p.
313.)&nbsp; We have an early presentation to the Benefice of
Waddingworth, in John Smith, clerk, appointed by Queen Elizabeth
to the Rectory, <i>vacant by the resignation of Thomas
Rumney</i>; this institution took place in 1563. <a
name="citation220a"></a><a href="#footnote220a"
class="citation">[220a]</a>&nbsp; This notice implies a good deal
more than it contains to the uninitiated.&nbsp; Thomas Rumney had
doubtless to resign, or rather was expelled from his living by
&ldquo;the bloody&rdquo; Queen Mary, because he was a Protestant,
and the living, like many others, remained for some years vacant,
until the Protestant Queen Elizabeth, succeeding her sister Mary,
had time to look about her, and she in 1562 filled the vacancy by
instituting John Smith.</p>
<p>In the Stixwould Register there is an entry relating to
Waddingworth, stating that Mr. George Townshend died at Halstead
Hall, and was buried at Waddingworth &ldquo;on Wensdaie night,
the 13 of February, 1627.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cause of this is
supposed to have been, that he was a Romanist, and therefore
could not legally be buried at a Protestant place of
worship.&nbsp; Mr. Rutland Snowden, and Mrs. Frances Townshend,
were married &ldquo;the 25 December, being Christmas daie,
1628.&rdquo;&nbsp; This looks rather as if, after a year&rsquo;s
delay after the death of Mr. G. Townshend, to be respectable,
Mrs. Townshend, his widow, married Mr. Rutland Snowden. <a
name="citation220b"></a><a href="#footnote220b"
class="citation">[220b]</a>&nbsp; I find another record that Mr.
George Townshend of Halstead Hall, by will, dated 1627 (he
evidently dying rather suddenly) left his land in Waddingworth to
his second son, George, the executor being Nicholas Larke, parson
of Waddingworth.&nbsp; This Mrs. Townshend was the widow of an
Evington of Halstead Hall, so that she had three husbands,
Rutland Snowden being the last, and by him she had several
children.&nbsp; He <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>was the son of the Bishop of Carlisle.&nbsp; They
lived, it is recorded, at Horncastle, as they naturally would do,
the Bishop being then officially the Lord of the Manor of
Horncastle, having his episcopal residence near the present manor
house.&nbsp; He was buried at Horncastle in 1654, and his wife in
1658.&nbsp; Richard Evington, of Halstead Hall, according to an
old record, on his death in 1612, left 40<i>s.</i> to Abdeel and
Joel Larke, sons of the above-named Mr. Nicholas Larke, parson,
of Waddingworth.&nbsp; The will of George Snowdon, of
Waddingworth, was proved in 1704.&nbsp; He left his lands in
Waddingworth and Horsington to his nephew, Edward Dymoke, of
Lincoln, gentleman, and to his heirs.&nbsp; It is not clear who
this George Snowdon was, but Jane Snowden, granddaughter of
Rutland and Frances Snowden, married Charles Dymoke, of
Scrivelsby, and died childless in 1743; and Abigail Snowden,
daughter of the same Rutland and Frances Snowden, married Edward
Dymoke, younger son of Sir Edward Dymoke, of Scrivelsby, from
whom sprang the Tetford branch, who now hold the property of
Scrivelsby and the Championship; and so Waddingworth passed to
the Dymokes.&nbsp; There is still a tablet in the church of
Waddingworth referring to these parties.&nbsp; It is a slab of
black marble in the pavement, in the centre of the nave, and runs
as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Here lyes ye body of Edward Dymoke,
Esq., son of Edward Dymoke, of Tumby, in the County of Lincoln,
Esq., grandson of the Hon<sup>ble</sup>. Sir Edward Dymoke,
Champion of England.&nbsp; He married Mary, daughter and
co-heiress of John Lodington, Esq., <a name="citation221"></a><a
href="#footnote221" class="citation">[221]</a> relict of Captain
Booth, of Market Rasen, in the county of Lincoln, and died April
29, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1729, aged 78 years,
leaving Jane, his only surviving daughter and heir, married to
Edward Southwell, Esq. of Wisbeach, in the county of
Cambridge.&nbsp; Here also lies interred Abigail, daughter of the
said Edward Dymoke and Mary his wife, who died March 22nd, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1708, aged 17 years.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Above this inscription are the crest, a sword and mantle, and on
the shield, two lions, crowned, passant.&nbsp; In course of time
the manor passed, through the above marriage, to Edward
Southwell, of the Trafford Southwell family, who now live at
Wroxham, in Norfolk, and who, with the Vyners of Gautby, own the
parish.</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>The
old Manor House, or Hall, stood in the centre of the parish, and
was at one time occupied by the Calthrop family, until they
removed to West Ashby Manor, near Horncastle; the last of them
residing there is remembered by the present writer, and there is
a memorial in Ashby Church of Richard Calthrop, an officer who
fell during the siege of Algiers.&nbsp; John Calthrop afterwards
removed to Stanhoe Hall, in Norfolk.&nbsp; The old Hall of
Waddingworth was a ruin 60 years ago, and afterwards pulled
down.&nbsp; The outline of it can still be traced.&nbsp; The
interesting old Rectory, of mud and stud, still survives as a
cottage, to the north of the churchyard.&nbsp; There is an
inverted base of a churchyard cross still remaining on the south
side of the Church.&nbsp; Over the west door, which is of the
Perpendicular style, but sadly dilapidated, is a reticulated
window, and above that, let into the wall, is an Early English
tombstone, or, more probably, a &ldquo;consecration cross,&rdquo;
carved as a &ldquo;cross flory,&rdquo; in heraldic phrase.</p>
<p>It is recorded that some ancient armour was some years ago
found in a cottage in the parish, consisting of the helmet,
breast-plate, back-piece, and gorget of a cavalier, probably a
fugitive from the battle of Winceby.</p>
<p>The Church, although now so dilapidated, was rebuilt in 1808,
the previous edifice having been a much handsomer and larger
structure.</p>
<p>There was a very remarkable case of robbery, which occurred
near this parish, on January 2nd, 1841, and which is recorded in
the &ldquo;Stamford Mercury,&rdquo; of March 12th, of that year,
with which we may fitly close our records of Waddingworth.</p>
<p>Mr. James Turner, a considerable farmer, of Waddingworth,
declared, on his own public affidavit, that he was attacked by
robbers when riding home from Horncastle market, for, be it
remembered, gigs were then little used; men rode to and from
market, and carried their wives behind them on pillions (as the
present writer has frequently seen, as a boy).&nbsp; To use Mr.
Turner&rsquo;s words, he said, &ldquo;When I had proceeded a
quarter-of-a-mile through the village of Thimbleby (which he
needs must pass), a little after 6 o&rsquo;clock, p.m., I
observed three men, walking in the middle of the road, about 100
yards before me.&nbsp; I was riding at a canter, as it was
moonlight.&nbsp; Two of the men walked in the &lsquo;ruts,&rsquo;
on either side, and one in the middle.&nbsp; He was a little
behind the others, and he remained so, till <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>I nearly
rode over him.&nbsp; I tried to turn out of the road, to avoid
him, but I then found he had seized my horse by the rein.&nbsp;
The two men said &lsquo;good night,&rsquo; and I replied to the
same effect.&nbsp; I then said to the man, &lsquo;What!&nbsp; Are
you going to rob me?&rsquo;&nbsp; He made no reply, and I struck
him with my stick on the head.&nbsp; The mare I was riding then
began to plunge, and the other two took hold of me, and dragged
me from my saddle.&nbsp; I lit on my feet, but the mare got
away.&nbsp; I struggled with the men, and got away from
them.&nbsp; The two stood on my left, and as I saw the third
coming in on my right, I struck at him, and he for the moment
gave way, but then, supported by the others, he again sprang at
me, and seized me by the collar (which in those days were
large).&nbsp; The three then threw me to the ground, and placed a
stick across my throat, and so kept me down.&nbsp; They hurt me
considerably, but I lifted the stick across my throat to my chin,
which was much bruised.&nbsp; They then tore my waistcoat open
and took from my pocket a book containing blank cheques and
memorandums, and my game license.&nbsp; On this, they began
muttering among themselves, and the one who first attacked me,
said, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s your money?&rsquo;&nbsp; I threw
myself, as much as I could, on one side, to protect my
&lsquo;fob,&rsquo; but they tore my breeches open, and took from
my right-hand pocket two canvas purses, in one of which I had two
notes and some silver, and in the other &pound;5 in gold.&nbsp;
They took all this, and an old-fashioned silver watch, and some
loose coins besides.&nbsp; I begged them not to murder me.&nbsp;
They took from my mackintosh a small bundle and threw it on the
road, which contained my banking book and memorandum book, both
of which I subsequently recovered.&nbsp; They then struck, or
kicked, me violently in the ribs, and ran through a gate into a
field, towards Edlington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Turner testified to his recognising the men, as it was a
moonlight night, and he had seen one of them before, in Bucknall,
an almost adjoining parish.&nbsp; Further evidence was very
strong against them.&nbsp; Anne Dawson, whose husband kept the
&ldquo;Nag&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; Inn, at Bardney, proved that,
earlier on the same day, three men had called at the Inn, for
refreshment, and took the road for Thimbleby.&nbsp; Joseph
Aukland also testified that, in returning from Horncastle market,
the same evening, he saw the men only a few yards from the spot,
before the robbery took place.&nbsp; <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>At the &ldquo;Ram&rdquo; Inn, at
Stourton, three men called about 8.30 p.m., to have some ale, for
which they paid, apparently (as was noticed) having plenty of
money, and asked their way to Market Rasen.&nbsp; On the next
morning, Sunday, at 7.30 a.m., one of them entered the
&ldquo;White Hart,&rdquo; the leading hotel in Rasen, and had
refreshment.&nbsp; Later, two of them called at a shop at
Glentham, and produced two &pound;5 notes (such as were
stolen).&nbsp; They were then on their way to Gainsborough.&nbsp;
They subsequently went to the &ldquo;Dog and Gun&rdquo; Inn at
that place, and the landlord changed a &pound;5 note for them,
and a Mrs. Watson another of the same value.&nbsp; One of them,
next day, bought a new coat at Gainsborough, for &pound;4
13<i>s.</i>; one prisoner was taken at Lynn, in Norfolk, wearing
the said coat; and the others were subsequently captured, where
is not stated.&nbsp; The Judge pronounced the evidence to be most
decisive, and the sentence was &ldquo;Transportation for
Life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The victim of this outrage arrived at his home
late that night, in rather a sorry plight.&nbsp; I think readers
of this account will agree that Mr. James Turner made a very
brave stand against such odds.&nbsp; He must have been a powerful
man, as his son, Mr. Jabez Turner, certainly was in his
day.&nbsp; I have myself been inside the house, for refreshment,
of Mr. James Turner when shooting on the farm, but the robbery
took place before I was old enough to carry a gun.&nbsp; So end
our annals of Waddingworth, with not the least stirring incident
in its history.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Winceby</span>.</h3>
<p>Winceby is situated about five miles south-east of Horncastle,
on the way to Old Bolingbroke.&nbsp; It is approached by a good
road, but leading up and down hills so steep as to render
travelling slow, either for man or beast.&nbsp; The village
itself stands on high ground commanding very extensive views; the
church of West Keal being a conspicuous object to the east; the
lofty tower of Boston looming in the distance, southward, many
miles away; Tattershall Castle and Church, the churches of
Coningsby, Heckington, and others in the Sleaford direction being
also visible, beyond the extensive tracts of fen barred by woods,
which intervene; while, on a clear day, the <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>prospect
extends across the Wash to the low-lying coast of Norfolk.&nbsp;
Northward stretches a tract, less extensive, of varied,
undulating ground, with the wooded heights of Warden Hill,
Brinkhill, &amp;c., forming the distant elevated horizon.&nbsp;
In early spring, or on a bright autumnal day, it would be
difficult to find a wider range of view, or more varied
colouring, to please the eye.&nbsp; The parish is small, being
but little more than 800 acres in extent, comprised in one large
farm, the homestead of which, a large, lofty, and somewhat
bleak-looking house, occupied by Mr. Edwd. Patchett, forms, with
its surrounding buildings and well-filled stackyard, a prominent
feature.&nbsp; Yet this humble village has had its associations
in the past of more than ordinary interest.</p>
<p>There are few parishes which have not some tradition connected
with the supernatural; and here, on the left of the road to
Winceby, in a hollow in Slash Lane, about half-a-mile before
reaching the village, there stood until recent years a large
boulder in the field close by.&nbsp; It was supposed to cover
hidden treasure, and various attempts were made at different
times to remove it, sometimes with six, or even eight
horses.&nbsp; At one of these attempts, his Satanic Majesty,
having been invoked by the local title of &ldquo;Old Lad,&rdquo;
appeared, it is said, in person, whereupon the stone fell back,
upsetting the horses.&nbsp; On another occasion a black mouse,
probably the same Being incarnate, in another form (compare
assistance rendered by a black mouse to the devil, in
Goethe&rsquo;s Faust), ran over the gearing of the horses, with a
similar result.&nbsp; Eventually, as a last resort, to break the
spell, the boulder was buried, and now no trace of boulder, black
mouse, or Satan&rsquo;s (Linc. &ldquo;Samuel&rsquo;s&rdquo;)
foot-print remains.</p>
<p>Domesday Book records that the Saxon Agemund held lands here,
and in the adjoining Claxby Pluckacre; and that Walter, a vassal
of the wealthy Norman Gozelin, also held land and a mill of the
yearly value of 4<i>s.</i>, while the still more powerful Norman,
Hugh de Abrincis (Avranches, in France), Earl of Chester, also
received a grant of land in this parish from his uncle, William
the Conqueror.&nbsp; Of this &ldquo;Baron bold,&rdquo; we may
observe, in passing, that he acquired the surname of Lupus, or
&ldquo;the wolf,&rdquo; from his many daring deeds.&nbsp; In
addition to almost the whole of the county of Chester, which gave
him his title, he held about 20 manors in Lincolnshire, 22 in
Leicestershire, <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>12 in Norfolk, 32 in Suffolk, besides several more in
other counties.&nbsp; Indeed, so large were his possessions, and
so great his power, that the terms of the royal grant to him
stated that he held his properties, not &ldquo;de capite,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;in chief,&rdquo; of the Sovereign, as was almost
universally the case, but &ldquo;tam libere ad gladium, sicut Rex
ipse tenebat Angliam ad coronam,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, as freely by
his sword, as the King did by his crown.&nbsp; It is recorded of
him, that he founded and endowed several monasteries, in England,
and elsewhere, &ldquo;for the good and salvation of his
soul&rdquo;; and it is n&auml;ively added, that &ldquo;if a tithe
of that be true which is related of him by the Chronicler,
Ordericus Vitalis (p. 787), he had needs enough to make some such
amends for his doings.&rdquo;&nbsp; He, however, seems, in his
latter days, to have attained to a proper sense of his actions,
since he closed his career, after a long illness, by adopting the
tonsure, as a monk of the Abbey of St. Werberg, of Chester, in
his own Barony.&nbsp; Few of these baronial possessions, however,
remained long in the families of those favourites to whom they
were granted by the Conqueror, solely by the right of
conquest.&nbsp; It had been asked long before, even by a Jezebel,
&ldquo;Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?&rdquo;&nbsp; And
there were Norman Omris and Zimris.&nbsp; It was a matter of
natural, as well as of retributive justice, that, when the grip,
by which the strong held his own, lost its vigour, even the
strongest should make way for &ldquo;a stronger than
he.&rdquo;&nbsp; And although the proud Lupus lorded it over
demesnes in Hag, Salmonby, Tetford, Brinkhill, Langton, Greetham,
and in many another parish, beside Winceby, yet at a later period
we find another powerful family, the Gaunts, in the ascendant,
and the Duke of Lancaster, John de Gandivo, was &ldquo;Dominus
Manerii de Winceby&rdquo; (Harl. MS., Brit. Mus., vol. iii., p.
770); and Walter de Gaunt granted to the Abbey of Bardney, which
had been re-founded by his father, Gilbert de Gaunt, after being
in ruins some 200 years, the tithes of his Fee in Winceby.&nbsp;
(Dugdale&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monasticon&rdquo; ed. 1682, p.
143).&nbsp; But not yet even was &ldquo;fixity of tenure&rdquo; a
feature of the times.&nbsp; Every dog has (only) his day; other
owners followed not now known, and Winceby is now also owned by a
name unknown to fame in the representative of the Hill family,
who purchased the estate from C. Manwaring, Esq.&nbsp; But the
Domus Dei should be a spot undesecrated by earthly <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>broils, a
fold unviolated by &ldquo;the wolf,&rdquo; and although the
Church, erected at Winceby, possibly by the proud Lupus himself,
&ldquo;for the good of his soul,&rdquo; has, in its original
fabric, passed away, yet there still stands on the same site, a
place of worship, small indeed, but not unworthy of its holy
purpose.&nbsp; Dedicated to St. Margaret, the special Saint of
purity undefiled, <a name="citation227"></a><a
href="#footnote227" class="citation">[227]</a> it fitly stands on
an isolated knoll, which on one side looks down on a deep gorge;
with the few cottages of the, some 60, inhabitants clustering
near at hand; with the great farm house, Winceby hall, standing
out eastward, and the picturesque modern Rectory, peacefully
embowered in trees and shrubbery, one field away to the west, the
calm and comfortable retreat of the Rev. C. E. Bolam, Rector of
Lusby, the Rector of Winceby being the Rev. Brice-Smith, resident
at Hameringham.</p>
<p>Until recent years, the church had, in the course of time,
degenerated into a small, mean thatched edifice; but, during the
late incumbency of the Rev. William Wordsworth Talfourd, acting
in the spirit of that &ldquo;high priest of nature,&rdquo; whose
name he bore, the fabric was reconstructed in early English
style; the nave being built at the expense of the late Mr.
Charles Hill, of Winceby House, and the chancel by the
rector.&nbsp; It consists of nave, chancel, porch, and bell
turret.&nbsp; Its chief features are as follows:&mdash;In the
north wall of the nave are two pairs of narrow pointed windows,
within debased arches; the south wall has the same, with a porch,
having narrow pointed arch.&nbsp; The font, of stone, has a
circular bowl, relieved by four small quatrefoils, at the four
quarters, a circular shaft, and square pediment.&nbsp; The west
window is a cinquefoil, surrounded by eight small
quatrefoils.&nbsp; The pulpit and seats are of light deal.&nbsp;
The east window of the chancel, the gift of Miss Talfourd, is of
three distinct trefoiled compartments, of coloured glass, the
central one rather larger than the other two, and surmounted by a
quatrefoil.&nbsp; The subjects are, in the centre, the
Crucifixion; in the northern one, Christ blessing little
children; in the southern, the Last Supper.&nbsp; In the south
wall of the chancel is a single-light trefoil, window, with three
small quatrefoils above; <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>its subject being, Christ and the
Magdalen, or &ldquo;Noli me tangere&rdquo;; a brass tablet states
that this is &ldquo;in memory of Frances Talfourd, March 9,
1862.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sedilia in the chancel are of handsome,
modern, substantial oak.&nbsp; The roof throughout is of pitch
pine.&nbsp; The one bell hangs in a turret supported by eight
pilasters.&nbsp; The living is in the gift of the Lord
Chancellor.&nbsp; The register dates from 1579.&nbsp; Among the
entries are the following:&mdash;&ldquo;1773, Thursday, June
28th, &mdash; Spenly buried.&nbsp; He was servant to Thomas
English, and instantly killed with thunder and lightening in the
house of his master, about 5 o&rsquo;clock the evening
before.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the two following, we do not see the
object of the financial computation, unless the party making the
entry was hypochondriac on the subject of &pound; s. d.&nbsp;
&ldquo;1698 Mary daughter of Tho. Jeffery, ffarmer (not worth six
hundred pounds) and Anne, his wife, baptised, October
23rd.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;1699.&nbsp; A similiar entry of John
Bowsley, ffarmer, being not worth &pound;600.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The main interest of Winceby is as being the scene of the
decisive battle, commonly called &ldquo;Winceby fight,&rdquo;
between the forces of the Royalists and the Parliamentarians
which took place on Wednesday, Oct. 11, 1643.</p>
<p>We have only space here for a brief account of that
engagement, which was important in its effect.&nbsp; We quote
from a curious contemporary record, written by a Parliamentarian,
and who apparently took part in the events described. <a
name="citation228"></a><a href="#footnote228"
class="citation">[228]</a>&nbsp; The Parliamentary army, then in
the neighbourhood of Boston, after suffering a reverse near
Grantham, and gaining a doubtful victory at Gainsborough, had
been reinforced by Sir Thomas Fairfax; and Cromwell was also on
his way to join it, with a valuable body of horse.&nbsp; To
prevent this formidable combination, the Marquis of Newcastle
from the north, hurried towards Boston, and despatched Sir John
Henderson, to intercept Cromwell.&nbsp; Forces belonging to both
sides had been encamped, on the previous night, in Horncastle,
Thimbleby, Edlington, and neighbouring villages, where skirmishes
had occurred.&nbsp; The main body under Manchester, <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>had moved
from near Boston to Bolingbroke, which was held by
Royalists.&nbsp; On the Monday night, Major Knight, in the name
of Manchester, had summoned the Castle of Bolingbroke (to
surrender); but was answered that &ldquo;his bug-bear words must
not winne castles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon Knight resolved the
next evening, to break open the Church doors, &ldquo;and there to
mount a morter-piece, and fire the Castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
events of the next day prevented this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those of the
Castle (the Royalists), killed one or two of our men; and, as
Major Knight, and the Quarter-master Generall Vermeyden were
viewing of it, made some shots at them, and one of them hit the
said Quarter-master Generall a little below the ancle, but
pierced not the skin, only bruised his leg.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seeing
that they were determined to resist, Manchester then moved to
East Kirkby; and his forces were encamped there, at Stickney, and
at different points around.&nbsp; Cromwell was encamped at
Winceby, in advance, with his &ldquo;light horse and
dragooners,&rdquo; where he passed the night.&nbsp; The
Royalists, under Sir John Henderson, pressed forward from
Horncastle, in order, if possible, to attack Cromwell, before the
main body had come up.&nbsp; But Cromwell did not object to hard
blows, and though his &ldquo;horse were extremly wearied with
hard duty,&rdquo; he calmly and sternly awaited the event.&nbsp;
&ldquo;About twelve of the clock . . . we began to descry the
enemy coming toward us.&nbsp; So soon as our men had knowledge of
(this), they were very full of joy and resolution, thinking it a
great mercie that they should now fight.&nbsp; Cromwell led the
van.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave the watchword &ldquo;Truth and
Peace,&rdquo; and then gave out a Psalm; and his troops moved on,
singing it, to charge the foe.&nbsp; They sustained a hostile
fire along the whole of their line, but they rode on unshaken, at
full speed.&nbsp; A second volley, at close quarters, killed
Cromwell&rsquo;s charger; and as he rose to his feet, &ldquo;he
was knockit down again by the gentleman who had charged him, who
&rsquo;twas conceived, was Sir Ingram Hopton;&rdquo; and for a
moment he lay as slain.&nbsp; But he who, as a child, had escaped
death in the arms of a monkey, was not to be so easily
extinguished; he recovered consciousness, and mounted a
trooper&rsquo;s horse; his opponent, Sir Ingram Hopton, was slain
in his turn; and &ldquo;this first charge was so home-given (says
the Chronicler), and with so much admirable courage and
resolution by our troops, that the enemy stood not <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>another,
but were driven back upon their own body, which was to have
seconded them, and at last put them into a plain disorder; and
thus, in less than half an hour&rsquo;s fight, they were all
quite routed.&nbsp; Our men pursued, and did execution upon them
about five or six miles; all the way being strewed with broken
arms, dead men and horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two hundred horses were
afterwards found left in Bolingbroke Castle, which had been
abandoned by the Royalists in a panic.&nbsp; Many hundreds of the
defeated fugitives rushed frantically into &ldquo;waters up to
their arm-holes <a name="citation230a"></a><a
href="#footnote230a" class="citation">[230a]</a>; they that lay
slain in the highways were very many; and divers of qualitie, for
there were brave bodies stript naked.&nbsp; The number of horses
taken were about 2000, of prisoners about 1000, . . . of arms
1500, and not 100 of the enemie (&rsquo;twas verily believed), to
be found in a body; of 94 standards 35 were taken, whereas (he
adds), wee but lost very few of our men, none of note, (and), wee
hardly found above one of our officers hurt.&rdquo;&nbsp; With
the Puritan&rsquo;s faith he exclaims, &ldquo;God himself did it
all, taking away the enemie&rsquo;s hearts, and giving resolution
and courage to our men; to him therefor be all the honour and
glory of this famous victory.&rdquo; <a
name="citation230b"></a><a href="#footnote230b"
class="citation">[230b]</a>&nbsp; This was a greater blow to the
Royalist cause than has commonly been estimated.&nbsp; Hitherto
the struggle had been carried on with varied fortune, but as yet
the Royalists had had no reason to despair, and had even achieved
considerable successes.&nbsp; At Winceby it may be said, the tide
decidedly set in against them.&nbsp; The struggle was prolonged;
but Lincoln was taken by Manchester&rsquo;s forces in the
following May (1644).&nbsp; In the same year was fought the
disastrous battle of Marston Moor; and the even more fatal fight
of Naseby in 1645.&nbsp; After that the issue was almost a
foregone conclusion.&nbsp; As to the actual scene of the fight,
the Royalists, from Horncastle, would seem to have advanced
slightly beyond the village, before they encountered the
enemy.&nbsp; The <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>name of &ldquo;Slash Lane,&rdquo; westward, still
surviving, tells its own tale of their wild flight towards the
town, which they had so lately left full of high hope.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;clap-gate&rdquo; farm at Holbeck, tells of hurried
movements in the dark hours of the night.&nbsp; The Winceby
registers record no increase of burials at the time.&nbsp; But
tradition avers that many were interred by the peasantry on
Scrafield hill-top.&nbsp; The one known burial is that of Sir
Ingram Hopton, whose body, by order of Cromwell himself, was
conveyed to Horncastle, that it might be interred in a manner
worthy of one, in whom he recognised &ldquo;a brave
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Wispington</span>.</h3>
<p>Wispington is situated about 4 miles from Horncastle, in a
north-westerly direction; adjoining Edlington on the east,
Baumber on the north, Waddingworth on the west, and Horsington
and Edlington on the south.&nbsp; Letters arrive from Horncastle
at 9 a.m.&nbsp; The nearest money order office is at Horncastle,
and telegraph office at Baumber.</p>
<p>Like two of the parishes just mentioned as contiguous, the
name of Wispington contains the Anglo-Saxon patronymic
&ldquo;ing.&rdquo;&nbsp; A Saxon settler named Uisp, or Wisp,
probably took up his residence here; his children formed the
&ldquo;family&rdquo; of Uisp, or Wisp-&ldquo;ing&rdquo;; and the
settlement or enclosure, which they occupied, was the
Uisp-ing-town, or Wispington. <a name="citation231"></a><a
href="#footnote231" class="citation">[231]</a>&nbsp; Under the
ruthless rule of William the Conqueror, these early occupants
would be displaced, and their land given to some favourite of
that King; under whom possibly the late Saxon thane, and his
family, might, at least, be allowed to labour as serfs.&nbsp;
Accordingly we find, in the great survey made for the Conqueror,
called &ldquo;Doomsday Book,&rdquo; because it recorded the doom
of so many, whom he subjugated, or dispossessed, two mentions of
this parish.&nbsp; The first of these, places it amongst the
possessions of William de Karilepho, who had been Abbot of St.
Vincent, but was promoted by the <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>Conqueror to the Bishopric of
Durham, as well as being made Chief Justice of England.&nbsp; Old
Chroniclers say that he was a man of great determination, but
regulated by judgment; and he ingratiated himself with the King,
who gave him large possessions in Lincolnshire, and other
counties; a quarrel, however, with the succeeding King, Rufus, so
wounded his pride, that he died of chagrin.&nbsp; He held of the
King, a large part of this parish, viz., 4 carucates (or 480
acres), 2 carucates of which were rateable to the tax called
&ldquo;gelt&rdquo; (2<i>s.</i> to the carucate, or 120
acres).&nbsp; Wispington is there said to be &ldquo;in the
soke&rdquo; of Great Stourton, and Kirkby-on-Bain, <i>i.e.</i>,
within the liberty, or under the jurisdiction, of those
parishes.&nbsp; There was no resident proprietor at that date,
but 9 sokemen (or free tenants) and 6 bordars worked the land
under their &ldquo;Mesne or Lord&rdquo; the land being his
&ldquo;de-mense&rdquo; or domain, <i>i.e.</i>, Lordship.&nbsp;
The second mention of the parish in Domesday gives its whole
extent as 8 carucates (or 960 acres), divided between the
above-named Bishop and another of the Conqueror&rsquo;s
favourites, not seldom named in these records, viz., Eudo, son of
Spirewic, Lord of Tattershall, who claimed, over the Bishop, the
lion&rsquo;s share, namely, two thirds of the parish.</p>
<p>How long the Bishops of Durham continued in possession does
not appear, but in the &ldquo;Lindsey Survey&rdquo; (circa <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, 1114) Ranulph, Bishop of that See,
had 9 carucates of land (or 1080 acres) in Wispington, Kirkby,
and two other parishes; and, according to the old record,
&ldquo;Testa de Nevill&rdquo; (p. 335), the Bishop of that day
still held the same (circa 1214, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>); while in the 46th year of the
reign of Edwd. III. (<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1373), on
the death of John Willoughby of Eresby, it is stated that he held
all his manors, among which Wispington is named, &ldquo;of the
Bishop of Durham, by the service of being his steward, and
carrying to the table the messes of meat, on the day of his
consecration, and on the feasts of Christmas and
Whitsuntide,&rdquo; so that, at that date, the Bishop would seem
to have been still the superior Lord of Wispington, as of the
other connected Manors.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Fragmenta
Antiquitatis&rdquo;; quoted &ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.,&rdquo; July
1896, p. 38).</p>
<p>After this period the ownership is not quite clear.&nbsp; But
this we can state.&nbsp; We have seen that Eudo, son of Spirewic,
owned two thirds of Wispington, by gift from the <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>Conqueror.&nbsp; His son, Hugh Fitz Eudo, commonly
called Brito, founded Kirkstead Abbey, in 1137, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, and that religious house, at a
later period, became possessed of land in Wispington, and the
benefice thereof.&nbsp; But meanwhile the ownership changed more
than once.&nbsp; From the Lansdowne M.S. (207 e., f. 455) in the
British Museum, we find that Walter Bek, <a
name="citation233"></a><a href="#footnote233"
class="citation">[233]</a> who had come from Flanders, late in
the 12 century, married Agnes, daughter of Pinso, and became,
through his wife, Lord of Spilsby, Eresby, Lusby, Wispington, and
other parishes; so that Eudo, and his later representatives, seem
to have passed from the scene, and the successors of his quondam
companion in arms, Pinso, to have taken their place.</p>
<p>By a Court Roll (9. Richard I., <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, 1198), it appears that Philip, son
of Robert, &ldquo;put in a plea against Henry Bek, for a
Knight&rsquo;s fee,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, a certain portion of land
&ldquo;in Tattershall, Wispington, and Kirkby.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Architect S. Journ,&rdquo; xxiv. pt. i. p. 39).</p>
<p>We further find, from &ldquo;Testa de Nevill,&rdquo; (p. 335,
&ldquo;Wapentake of Horncastle,&rdquo;) that Simon de Driby,
held, &ldquo;of the Fee of Tattershall,&rdquo; (circa <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1215), lands in Kirkby,
Waddingworth, Wispington, and other places under Robert of
Tattershall; the Wispington portion, therefore, was probably that
formerly held by Eudo.</p>
<p>When Walter Bek&rsquo;s sons succeeded to his property, the
eldest, Henry, received as his portion the manors of Spilsby,
Scrivelsby, Wispington, etc.&nbsp; (Harleian MS., 3720, f.
23.)</p>
<p>With the beginning of the 14th century, another prominent
family is found connected with this parish.&nbsp; Sir William
Willoughby married Alice, daughter of John Bek, Lord of Eresby;
and a &ldquo;Feet of Fines,&rdquo; of date <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1304, (Lincoln, file 69, 31 Edwd.
I.) shows that a <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>law-suit arose between John Bek, plaintiff, and Robert
Willoughby, defendant, as to the possession of lands in
Wispington, Thimbleby, Langton, Woodhall, etc., and the advowson
of Wispington, which ended in a compromise, Robert granting the
lands and advowson to John, for his life-time, but to revert, on
his decease, to Robert and his heirs for ever.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Architect S. Journal,&rdquo; xxiv. p. 52).&nbsp; The
manor and advowson of Wispington thus passed to the ancestors of
the Lords of Willoughby.&nbsp; In the next century, we find these
transferred to Kirkstead Abbey, as shown by the following entry,
in the &ldquo;Kalendar of Patent Rolls
1399&ndash;1401&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;1401, April 20.&nbsp;
Licence paid in the hanaper for Philip de Dispenser, Knight;
James Roos, knight; Eudo de Zouche, clerk; Richard de Wynnewick,
clerk; Richard de Chesterfield, clerk; Henry Malbys, parson of
the Church of Wylughby; and Thomas Fitz William of Mablethorpe,
to grant in mortmain a toft and 4 bovates of land, in Wyspyngton,
and the advowson of the Church of the same town, not held in
chief, to the Abbot, and Convent of Kirkstede, in aid of their
maintenance.&rdquo; (p. 477). <a name="citation234"></a><a
href="#footnote234" class="citation">[234]</a></p>
<p>This was further confirmed, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1401, May 2, with the addition that the &ldquo;Abbot and Convent
of Kirkstede&rdquo; might &ldquo;serve the Benefice by a
Chaplain, Monk, or Secular&rdquo; (pp. 278, 279).</p>
<p>We are, after this period, unable to give (as has been done in
the cases of some other parishes), a connected series of
proprietors.&nbsp; There are however, various scattered records
of individual owners, which possess some interest.&nbsp; In a
Bardney Abbey Charter, lately recovered by the Rev. J. A. Penny,
the present Vicar of Wispington, Thomas Sely of Wispington, and
Henry son of Andrew, of the same place, are witnesses to a deed,
of date May 22, 1281, signed in the Chapter House of that
Monastery, &ldquo;on the <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>Sunday next after the Ascension of
our Lord,&rdquo; by which the Abbot of that House gives up for
himself and his successors, all claim to his bondman, William,
son of Peter Hardigray, with all his goods and chattels, in
favour of Thomas Thorley of Gautby.&nbsp; It is worthy of notice,
that, by another charter, this same Thomas Thorley, of Gautby,
grants to the above William Hardigray, no longer a bondman, but
Rector of Mareham, certain lands and tenements in the adjoining
parish of Edlington.&nbsp; The two were, therefore, evidently
close friends.&nbsp; This deed is witnessed by Henry, son of
John, of Wispington, Simon Francis, of Edlington, William son of
Master Bartholomew, of Thimbleby, and others.</p>
<p>By a third charter, dated at Edlington, the day of Mercury
(Wednesday) next after the feast of St. Michael, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1285, William, son of William of
Wispington, gives, grants, and confirms, to the same William
Hardigray, now of Edlington, clerk, a toft with the tenements
thereon, situated in Edlington, for which he is to pay annually
the rent of one farthing, at the feast of Easter. <a
name="citation235"></a><a href="#footnote235"
class="citation">[235]</a></p>
<p>Among Gibbons&rsquo; &ldquo;Early Lincolnshire Wills&rdquo;
(pp. 35, 36.) we find, that Henry de Brauncewell, Canon of
Lincoln, by will in 1395, leaves money to his poor parishioners,
at Wispington, Leasingham, St. Peter&rsquo;s at Arches, and
elsewhere.</p>
<p>We now get another name, which was one of weight in this
parish and elsewhere for many years.&nbsp; Among the list of
noblemen and gentry, who subscribed for the defence of the
country, when the Spanish Armada was expected, in 1589, we find
the name of &ldquo;Roberte Phillippes, of Wispington,&rdquo; who,
like his neighbour Vincent Welby, of Halstead Hall, contributed
&pound;25, which was a large sum in those days.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; vol. ii., p. 133).&nbsp; In the
next century, among the list of gentry of Lincolnshire, made on
the Herald&rsquo;s Visitation, in 1634, along with the well-known
names of Heneage, Pelham, Massingberd, Monson, &amp;c., we also
find Robert Phillips, of Wispington.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp;
Q.&rdquo; vol. ii., p. 73).</p>
<p><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>This
family, which afterwards by marriage acquired the name of Glover,
<a name="citation236"></a><a href="#footnote236"
class="citation">[236]</a> possessed property outside of
Wispington, for we find from a bond dated October 25, 1735, that
disputes having arisen as to the boundary of the estate of
Phillips Glover, at Walmsgate, and that of the estate of Matthew
Lister, of Burwell Park, adjoining it, the two proprietors agreed
to place 12 stones, in the presence of witnesses, to fix for the
future the line of separation between the properties.&nbsp;
(Notes on the Manor of Burwell, by R. W. Goulding;
&ldquo;Architect. S. Journal,&rdquo; xxiv., pt. i., p. 91.)&nbsp;
Other records in connection with this family, are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Walter Harpham, by his will dated 10 Feb.
1607&ndash;8, leaves the reversion of &pound;100 to Alice
Phillips, his daughter, and &pound;300 to his granddaughter,
Elizabeth Phillips, and to his grandson, Willoughby Phillips,
&pound;100, and makes his son-in-law, Thomas Phillips,
executor.&nbsp; (Maddison&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wills of
Lincolnshire,&rdquo; 1600&ndash;1617, p. 180).</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; John Holland, of Hemingby, by will, of date 15
Sep., 1608, leaves 20s. to Mr. Stephen Phillips, of Wispington,
for supervising his will.&nbsp; (Maddison&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wills of
Lincolnshire,&rdquo; 1600&ndash;1617, p. 27.)</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; Margery Neale, of Horncastle, by her will, dated
July 10, 1611, leaves to Jane Phillips, wife of Vincent Smithe,
&pound;6 in money, herself to keep &pound;3 of it, and to give
&pound;3 to her daughter Elizabeth, &ldquo;my
Goddaughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ibidem, p. 51.)</p>
<p>In the Register of Admissions to Gray&rsquo;s Inn, London
(edited by J. Foster, 1889), &ldquo;Robert Phillips, of
Wispington, Co., Lincoln,&rdquo; is named as a student
&ldquo;admitted Feb. 7, 1653&ndash;4.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phillips Glover, Esq., of Wispington, or Colonel Glover,
married, circa. 1790, being then resident at Stainfield, Rebecca,
eldest daughter of Mr. William Jepson Proctor, Chapter Clerk,
&amp;c., of the Bail, Lincoln, and sister to the Rev. George
Jepson, M.A., Prebendary of Lincoln, 1781&ndash;1787.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; vol. ii., p. 150).</p>
<p><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>Colonel Glover had a daughter, who married Robert
Vyner, Esq., of Eathorpe, Co. Warwick, and had a numerous
family.&nbsp; He, or more probably his father, was Sheriff of the
county of Lincoln, in the year 1727.&nbsp; Early in the 19th
century was issued a large mezzotint portrait of Phillips Glover,
Esq., of Wispington, described &ldquo;as a steady disinterested
friend, who never courted popularity, but was ever deserving of
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Linc. N. &amp; Q.&rdquo; vol. ii., p.
87).&nbsp; The Glovers, or Phillipses, were patrons of the
Benefice; John Phillips, according to &ldquo;Liber Regis,&rdquo;
presenting in 1707, and Mrs. Glover in 1755.&nbsp; In 1769,
&ldquo;pro hac vice,&rdquo; Henry Martinson, Gent., presented,
having doubtless bought the next presentation, since we find his
relative John Martinson, instituted to the vicarage at that
date.&nbsp; On his death a Glover presented for the last time,
the entire property being subsequently sold to Mr. Turnor, of
Stoke Rockford, Panton, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The Glovers, and Phillipses, had a fine residence here, of
which extensive traces still remain, in moats, fish ponds, and
terraced mounds, some 500 yards in length, and covering 5 or 6
acres.&nbsp; The series of ponds and moats are arranged so as to
curl about in a curious serpentine shape, forming the outline of
a snake with double head.&nbsp; This apparent survival of an old
serpent worship, is not unusual in such ancient places as Abury
Hill, on Salisbury Plain; Stanton Drew, in Somersetshire; Carnac,
in Brittany; &amp;c.&nbsp; (Dean&rsquo;s &ldquo;Worship of the
Serpent,&rdquo; 1833); but here it would seem to indicate a
greater antiquity than the time of the Glover family.&nbsp; The
gardens, and &ldquo;pleasaunce,&rdquo; surrounding the residence,
must have been very extensive; the farmhouse, now occupied by Mr.
Andrew Evison, was part of this residence, and there is some old
brickwork among the farm buildings, said to have been part of a
private chapel. <a name="citation237"></a><a href="#footnote237"
class="citation">[237]</a>&nbsp; To the east was an avenue of
fine trees, of great age, which were felled in the first half of
the 19th century.&nbsp; The family continued at Wispington down
to recent times, though in greatly reduced circumstances, the
last of them being the Rev. Robert Glover, vicar of the parish
from 1795 to 1838.&nbsp; He died leaving a numerous <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>family,
scantily provided for. <a name="citation238a"></a><a
href="#footnote238a" class="citation">[238a]</a>&nbsp; During his
time the church and parsonage would seem to have participated in
the dilapidated condition of his own fortune, and in the Register
we find the following note, in his own hand:&mdash;&ldquo;The
chancell of this church fell in, on Friday the 22 day of
November, 1833, about 9 o&rsquo;clock at night, R. Glover,
vicar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now proceed to the church.&nbsp; Both Weir and Saunders
state that the edifice, in their day, was without interest.&nbsp;
The late Rev. Charles Pratt Terrott, who was appointed to the
vicarage, in 1838, by Mr. Christopher Turnor, took down this
decayed structure, and erected an entirely new church; and, being
well-known as an arch&aelig;ologist of wide learning, and
cultivated tastes, <a name="citation238b"></a><a
href="#footnote238b" class="citation">[238b]</a> with the aid of
the architect, Mr. G. B. Atkinson, of York, he produced a church,
which, though small, as the population only required, is one of
unusual interest.&nbsp; It was erected in 1863.&nbsp; In the
process of demolition of the former church, two late Norman
capitals cut from one stone, <a name="citation238c"></a><a
href="#footnote238c" class="citation">[238c]</a> were discovered,
indicating that there had, at one time, been a Norman edifice
here; and, from other relics, it was apparent that this early
structure, had been either rebuilt or added to in the 13th
century.&nbsp; That building, however, had in turn been
superseded by a wretched fabric of no architectural pretensions,
now, happily, gone the way of its more worthy predecessors.&nbsp;
The present church, dedicated like so many others in the
neighbourhood to St. Margaret, is of the Early English style, and
consists of a tower with spire, nave, south porch, chancel, and
vestry on the north <a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>side of the chancel, from which, for
economy of space, access is had to the pulpit, standing in the
north-east corner of the nave.&nbsp; The nave has coupled lancet
windows in the north and south walls; there are detached lancet
windows, with a trefoiled light above them, in the west tower
wall; and a triplet at the east end of the chancel, and two
single lights in its south wall.&nbsp; The tower and spire are
almost a copy of the small but elegant spire of Woodhall St.
Margaret.&nbsp; It is supported within by the rather unusual
arrangement of a narthex or arcade of three arches, and two
pillars, instead of the more common single arch.&nbsp; The walls
are relieved by coloured patterns running round the windows, and
various devices elsewhere, which have a very pleasing
effect.&nbsp; The roof of the nave is supported by corbels
bearing the symbols of the Evangelists.&nbsp; The pulpit is of
Caen stone, with coloured marble shafts, the panels having
sculptures, the work of Mr. Terrot, assisted by Mr. Watson Moore,
of Horncastle; they represent the Nativity, Nathan and David, and
the return of the Prodigal.&nbsp; The font, of the same
materials, is adorned with medallions, also carved by the
reverend artist, representing the animals mentioned in the New
Testament, arranged in groups and intermingled with
foliage.&nbsp; Mrs. Terrot&rsquo;s artistic skill is also shown
in the carving of the figure of St. Margaret, placed above a
dedication stone in the western wall of the nave, and in various
bosses and capitals, as well as in the oaken eagle lectern.&nbsp;
The paving of the nave alley is of red and black tiles; that of
the chancel of Minton&rsquo;s encaustic tiles, their richness
being increased within the altar rails.&nbsp; The reredos is of
the same material, but differing in character.&nbsp; The subjects
in the coloured east window, by Messrs Ward and Hughes, are
scenes from our Lord&rsquo;s life on earth; and in the western
window, are the figures of St. Margaret, and St. John the
Baptist, by the same artists.&nbsp; These were provided through
the efforts of Mrs. Terrot, who also obtained the 3rd bell to
complete the set.&nbsp; The three bells bear the following
inscriptions:&mdash;(1) &ldquo;Ave Maria Graci&aelig;
Plena&rdquo; (diameter 26&frac34; inches); (2) &ldquo;Cast by
John Warner and Sons, London&rdquo; (diameter 28 inches); (3)
&ldquo;Sancta Maria Ora Pro Nobis&rdquo; (diameter 36&frac34;
inches).&nbsp; It is curious that the only bells in a minor key,
in this neighbourhood, are those of Baumber and Wispington,
contiguous parishes.</p>
<p>Between the font and the west window is a blue slate <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>slab,
having the inscription &ldquo;Here lyeth the body of Robert
Phillips, gentleman, who departed this life, the 24th day of
June, 1668.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the south side of this stone, close
to it, lies the body of Phillips Glover, Esq.&nbsp; On a white
marble monument on the north wall of the chancel, are the arms
and crest, of the Phillips family; crest, a white eagle, with
blue crown round its neck, on a hemlet, mantled, the visor
closed; arms, azure, party per chevron, argent, three white
eagles with azure crowns round their necks passant, 1 and
2.&nbsp; Below is the inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;To the memory of
John Phillips, Esq., this monument is dedicated by his nephew and
heir, Phillips Glover, Esq.&nbsp; He was the second and last
surviving son of Robert Phillips, Esq., who lies buried in this
chancel.&nbsp; He died unmarried on the 19th of February,
1719&ndash;20, aged 62, and in him his family was extinct.&nbsp;
In memory of Phillips Glover, Esq: He married Mary daughter and
heiress of Richard Lee, Esq., of Winslade, in Devonshire, and
left two children, Phillips and Mary.&nbsp; He died, June 28,
1745.&nbsp; Veri cultor et Libertatis.&nbsp; This inscription by
his order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opposite this monument is one of white marble, on the south
side of the chancel, behind the desk.&nbsp; The arms and crest
are the same, with this inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;Near this place
lyeth ye bodye of Robert Phillips, Esq., who departed this life,
ye 24th of June, 1668.&nbsp; And of Stephen Phillips, Esq.,
eldest son of Robert, who departed this life, ye 9th of Feb.,
1682&ndash;3.&nbsp; And of Robert Phillips, of London, Goldsmith,
third son of Robert Phillips, who departed this life, the 12 of
December, 1707.&nbsp; And of Benjamen Phillips, merchant, fourth
son of ye above said Robert, who departed this life, Aug. ye 8th,
1715, &aelig;t 49.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the instruments of the Passion, in a medallion above the
vestry door, in the chancel (which are really the masonic signs
of a Knight Templar&rsquo;s encampment, <a
name="citation240"></a><a href="#footnote240"
class="citation">[240]</a>) is a tablet with this
inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;To the memory of the Rev. Robert Merony
Glover, who was upwards of 43 years vicar of this parish.&nbsp;
He died Feb. 8th, 1838, aged 62 years.&nbsp; He was the poor
man&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; Also of Ann, relic of the above Robert
Merony Glover, whose remains are interred in the family vault of
her parents, at Horncastle.&nbsp; Four of their children rest in
this chancel.&nbsp; This tablet is consecrated by the
affectionate and grateful survivors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>In
the vestry, on a tablet on the north wall, is this
inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;Sacred to the memory of the Rev. John
Martinson, late vicar of this church, and rector of Screamby, who
departed this life, the 16th of July, 1788, aged 51
years.&rdquo;&nbsp; An incised slab, now in the floor of the
vestry, but whence removed is not known, has an inscription to
John Hetherset, &ldquo;Rector,&rdquo; in 1399.&nbsp; The figure
is habited in full canonicals, even to the gloves.</p>
<p>The benefice is now only a &ldquo;vicarage&rdquo;; but the
explanation of this difference is, that, at that date, just
before the advowson was given to Kirkstead Abbey, it was a
rectory.&nbsp; When the rectorial tithes passed to the abbot, the
incumbent became the abbot&rsquo;s vicar.</p>
<p>In the south-east corner of the churchyard, is a tombstone
with the inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;In memory of the 18 children
of George and Mary Hannath, who all died in their infancy,
1831&ndash;1855. <a name="citation241"></a><a href="#footnote241"
class="citation">[241]</a>&nbsp; He shall gather the lambs in His
arms, and carry them in His bosom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the double lancet windows in the nave, nearest the
pulpit has been, within recent years, filled with coloured glass
in memory of the Rev. C. P. Terrot, by his widow.&nbsp; The
subjects are four:&mdash;(1) Bezaleel carving cherubim on the
altar, and overlaying them with gold; (2) Aholiab, the cunning
workman, looking at his work; (3) our Lord as a youth, working at
his trade of carpenter; (4) a medieval priest, presenting before
the altar, a small church, which is held in his hands.&nbsp; The
two small lancets in the south wall of the chancel have stained
glass to the memory of Colonel Charles Terrot, eldest son of the
Rev. C. P. Terrot.&nbsp; The subjects are two:&mdash;(1) Samuel
presented by Hannah in the Temple; (2) Joshua commanding the sun
to stand still.&nbsp; The small window over the font was
presented by Miss Terrot, the subject being the Holy Dove
hovering.&nbsp; Recently Mrs. Terrot presented to the church a
casket, containing an account of the restoration, and contents,
of the church, beautifully bound.&nbsp; This is kept on a bracket
in the east wall of the nave, opposite the pulpit.</p>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>We
give here a list of the vicars of this parish during the last two
and a half centuries.&nbsp; William Azlack, 1662&ndash;1670; John
Smith, 1670&ndash;1707; Thomas Doughty, 1707&ndash;8&ndash;1754;
J. Carr, 1754&ndash;1769; John Martinson, 1769&ndash;1788;
William Chaplin, 1788&ndash;1795; Robert Merony Glover,
1795&ndash;1838; C. P. Terrot, 1838&ndash;1886; Beauchamp St.
John Tyrwhitt, 1886&ndash;1890; F. S. Alston, 1890&ndash;1896;
James Alpass Penny, 1896.</p>
<p>We have mentioned that the Glovers became very much reduced in
pecuniary means; when the Rev. Robert Merony Glover, died in
1838, he left the church, vicarage, and farmstead adjoining,
almost in ruins; and we think it should not go unrecorded, that
the Rev. Charles Pratt Terrot, who succeeded him, declined to
accept any compensation for these dilapidations, as the Glover
family were so poor.</p>
<p>An ancient font was placed in the church, June 2nd, 1841,
having been removed from the ruins of an oratory in the garden of
Poolham Hall.&nbsp; This is now the font in the church of
Woodhall St. Margaret, being placed there by the vicar, the
present writer.&nbsp; It is supported by 4 columns of serpentine,
the gift of the Rev. J. A. Penny, of Wispington.</p>
<p>The register dates from 1662.&nbsp; Some of the entries are
peculiar.&nbsp; From 1662 to 1667, the entries of baptisms
regularly alternate between children of William Azlack, clerk,
and Mary, his wife, and those of Robert Phillips, Esq., and Mary,
his wife; vicar and squire thus running each other &ldquo;neck
and neck&rdquo; in their progeny, a competition which curiously
is terminated by the demise of the vicar&rsquo;s wife, buried May
10th, 1668, and that of Mr. Robert Phillips, six weeks later, who
was buried June 26th, 1668.</p>
<p>On &ldquo;Oct. 18th, 1682, Mr. Philip Ormston, rector of
Skremby, was buried&rdquo; here.&nbsp; Why he was brought to
Wispington for burial does not appear, unless his Christian name
indicates relationship to the Phillips family.</p>
<p>On Oct. 27th, 1692, is registered the marriage of &ldquo;John
Spennly, weaver, and Isabel Hawstead, spinster.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
latter, doubtless derived her name from the neighbouring hamlet
of Halstead, in Stixwould, still pronounced
&ldquo;Haw-stead.&rdquo;&nbsp; The addition of
&ldquo;weaver&rdquo; to the husband&rsquo;s name is interesting,
as evidence of a bygone craft.&nbsp; Weaving and spinning were at
that time a common occupation of the <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>humbler classes. <a
name="citation243"></a><a href="#footnote243"
class="citation">[243]</a>&nbsp; The epithet
&ldquo;spinster&rdquo; we still retain, of the woman to be
married, but the term &ldquo;weaver&rdquo; for the man is now
obsolete.&nbsp; The Rev. J. A. Penny has part of a blanket, which
was woven by the great grandmother of a parishioner in
Wispington, now 60 years of age.</p>
<p>In 1792, we find &ldquo;Bartho (Bartholomew) Goe&rdquo;
signing as curate; a patronymic which, until recently, survived
in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Among a list of the Vicars of Boston,
Bartholomew Goe is given as appointed in 1817 (Thomson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Boston,&rdquo; p. 86).&nbsp; It may also be noticed that
on &ldquo;July 16th, 1788, John Martinson, vicar, was
buried&rdquo;; the next entry recording the burials of his
posthumous son, John, aged 8 weeks, on March 17th, 1789; while
the next entry again records the burial of his relict, Mary
Martinson, Sept. 21st, 1791.</p>
<p>On Nov. 2nd, 1710, &ldquo;William Peascodd of this parish, and
Amy Todd of ye parish of Bardney, were married&rdquo;; in
connection with which entry, we may mention, that there is in
Boston Church, within the altar rails, on the north side, a fine
brass of &ldquo;Walter Peascod, merchant, 1398.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opposite several of the names in the register, both in the
17th and 18th centuries, are appended curious
&ldquo;hieroglyphic&rdquo; signs, the meaning of which is, at the
least, obscure.</p>
<p>Of the communion plate, the cup and paten are dated 1712,
presented by John Phillips, Esq.</p>
<p>A group of trees in this parish is named &ldquo;Barrow
Plantation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether there existed formerly a
sepulchral barrow, which gave rise to the name, is not known; the
explanation given by the modern bucolic mind is that the spot is
haunted by a spectral wheelbarrow.</p>
<p>A tradition lingers here that, in the 18th century, a duel was
fought, around which the usual accretions have clustered; that
the combatants were two brothers, who were attached to the same
&ldquo;ladye fayre&rdquo;; that one killed the other; that they
fought in the avenue near the former hall of the Glovers; while,
in a pannelled bedroom at the adjoining hall farm, there is still
preserved a cupboard, which has not been opened for many years,
as it is supposed, in some way, to be connected with &ldquo;the
green <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>lady&rdquo; (such ladies are usually
&ldquo;green&rdquo;), who was the cause of the quarrel.&nbsp;
Careful enquiry, however, has ruthlessly swept away all of the
accumulated romance of this incident, and the bare facts are
found to be as follows, for which, it should be added, the writer
is indebted to a MS. in the possession of Captain Craggs, of
Threekingham Hall, confirmed by the &ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine&rdquo; of 1760, p. 246.:&mdash;Thursday, May 1st.&nbsp;
The combatants were Major Glover, of Wispington, of the
Lincolnshire Militia, and Mr. Jackson, an apothecary, of
Manchester.&nbsp; &ldquo;At a rehearsal, at the playhouse, in
that town, Mr. Jackson came behind the Major, and struck him on
the back, seemingly in joke, upon which the Major turned about
and with a switch struck Jackson, saying, also in joke,
&lsquo;What!&nbsp; Jackson, is it you?&rsquo;&nbsp; On this
Jackson, in a great passion, said &lsquo;D&mdash;n you, sir,
although you are a Major, I will not take this from
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Major, surprised at this, replied,
&lsquo;Why, what can you mean?&nbsp; I was only in joke, as well
as yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Jackson persisted in his anger, and
said he insisted on satisfaction.&nbsp; The Major was not able to
pacify him by saying that he meant no affront.&nbsp; But Jackson
insisted on fighting him with swords.&nbsp; They went to a
coffee-house, and there, in a back room, they fought.&nbsp; The
Major ran Mr. Jackson through the body, after which, on the
former leading Mr. Jackson through the coffee-room for
assistance, Mr. Jackson, owned, before several witnesses, that it
was entirely his own fault, and that he had been wounded by the
Major in a very fair and gentlemanlike manner; and that, if he
died, he entirely forgave the Major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unfortunate Mr. Jackson would seem to have incurred the
fatal penalty of his own folly; for, in the same magazine, under
the date &ldquo;Wednesday, Aug. 20th, 1760,&rdquo; p. 440, is the
following notice:&mdash;&ldquo;At the Assizes at Lancaster,
Philip Glover, Esq., Major in the Lincolnshire Militia, was found
guilty of manslaughter, for killing Mr. Jackson, of Manchester,
in a duel, and was immediately discharged out of custody in
court.&nbsp; It was with great difficulty that sufficient
evidence could be procured to induce the grand jury to find the
bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the one passage of arms, of which we know, connected with
Wispington, although fatal in its effect, is reduced to the farce
of human folly.&nbsp; From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a
step.</p>
<p><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>May
Wispington&rsquo;s future martial sons fight in a nobler cause
than that of self pride.</p>
<p>We may add, that at a court-martial held eight months later,
March 24th, 1762, Philip Glover was acquitted of any
&ldquo;behaviour contrary to the articles of war,&rdquo; but the
court was of opinion that he had, in hasty heat, used language to
Capt. Gardiner, contrary to good order and discipline, and he was
adjudged to be reprimanded publicly in the presence of the
officers and men of his regiment.&nbsp; The member of this
court-martial were the following:&mdash;Col. Lord Vincent
Mandeville, Hunts. Militia, president; Lieut.-Col. Richard
Townley, Lancashire Militia; Lieut.-Col. John Lister, Yorkshire
Militia; Major Robert Coney, Norfolk Militia; Major Sir Philip
Monoux, Bart., Bedfordshire Militia; Major Francis Longe, Norfolk
Militia; Capt. Edmund Townley, Lancashire Militia; Capt. Carr
Brackenbury, Lincolnshire Militia; Capt. G. De Ligne Gregory,
Lincolnshire Militia, and others; with the Honble. Charles Gould,
Deputy Judge Advocate General.</p>

&ldquo;Myntlyng&rdquo; MS., of Spalding Priory, is &ldquo;John

Ash,&rdquo; which in time became John Ash.&nbsp; The ash tree was
supposed to have peculiar virtues: weakly children were passed
through it three times, before sunrise, to give them strength;
and to the Rowan, or mountain-ash many superstitions are
attached.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Folklore,&rdquo; vol. ii., No. 1, p. 88,

water was a more marked feature of the locality 100 years
ago.&nbsp; Sir Joseph Banks, writing of the antiquities of Ashby,
in an article contributed to &ldquo;Arch&aelig;ologia&rdquo; at
that time (vol. xii., p. 96), mentions the &ldquo;sloping hills
with brisk rills of water running through almost every
valley.&rdquo;&nbsp; It should not be forgotten that formerly a
tract of forest extended all along this district, so that (as I
have mentioned elsewhere) a Dutch sportsman spent a whole season
in hunting &ldquo;in Lincolniensi montium tractu,&rdquo; among
the Lincolnshire hills.&nbsp; When that forest was cleared away,
as a natural consequence the streams would shrink in volume, or
disappear altogether.</p>

Stourton, East Kirkby, and other places.&nbsp; One of them
resided at East Kirkby as late as 1870.&nbsp; Sir William Eland
was Constable of Nottingham Castle, 1330, and M.P. for the county
in 1333 (Bailey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Annals,&rdquo; vol. i., p.
223).&nbsp; The Gedneys were considerable owners in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; In the church at Bag Enderby there is a
handsome stone mural monument of Andrew and Dorothy Gedney, with
their two sons and two daughters kneeling before prayer
desks.&nbsp; This Andrew Gedney married Dorothy, daughter of Sir
William Skipwith, of South Ormesby, by his wife, Alice
Dymoke.</p>

poem &ldquo;Walking to the Mail&rdquo; (Poems, 1842), tells of a
farmer who was so pestered by the presence of this ghost about
his house, that he harnessed his horse to his cart and started to
leave home to get rid of it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The farmer, vext, packs up his bed,<br />
And all the household stuff, and chairs,<br />
And with his boy betwixt his knees, his wife<br />
Upon the tilt&mdash;sets out and meets a friend,<br />
Who hails him, &lsquo;What! Art flitting?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re flitting,&rsquo; says the ghost,<br />
For they had packed her among the beds.<br />
&lsquo;Oh! Well!&rsquo; the farmer says, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
flitting with us too!<br />
&lsquo;Jack, turn the horse&rsquo;s head, and home
again.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

was probably granted to that body by her father, Henry VIII., on
the dissolution of the Tattershall College.&nbsp;

the hollowness of the beck, for on one occasion, when riding with
the foxhounds, there being a steep descent to the beck, and the
beck itself having rotten, hollow banks, the soil gave way
beneath his horse&rsquo;s hind legs, and, although they landed on
the other side, the horse was all in a heap, and the rider shot
over its head.&nbsp; They, however, recovered themselves, and no
other riders attempting it they gained a considerable advantage
over the rest of the field.&nbsp; When shooting along its banks
he has seen places where the hollowness was still more marked,
the beck itself being barely more than two feet wide, and four
feet, or even more, deep.</p>

smaller, and Weir in his History of Lincolnshire (vol. ii. p.

that as early as the reign of Edward I., a suit was instituted

&ldquo;A Ramble through the parish of St. Mary Magdalene,&rdquo;

giving an instance of the title &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; as applied to
the Clergy.&nbsp; A graduate of the University, having the M.A.
degree was styled &ldquo;Master&rdquo; so and so, but when in
Holy Orders, if he was only a B.A. he was styled
&ldquo;dominus,&rdquo; the English equivalent of which was
&ldquo;Sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a general style of address, and
was continued in the Isle of Man to a late period.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;A Short Treatise on the Isle of Man,&rdquo; by James
Chaloner, governor, date 1656, it is stated that all the clergy
who are natives have this title, even in one case a curate being
so styled.&nbsp; In Bale&rsquo;s &ldquo;Image of bothe
Churches&rdquo; (circa 1550), it is said, &ldquo;the most ragged
runagate among them is no less than a Sir, which is a Lord in the
Latin.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Pulleyn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Etymological
Compendium,&rdquo; we find &ldquo;The title of &lsquo;Sir&rsquo;
was given to all who had taken a degree, or had entered into
Orders.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, Hearne, the Antiquary, after he had
taken the degree of B.A., was addressed as &ldquo;Sir
Hearne&rdquo; (Aubrey&rsquo;s Letters, i. 117), and William
Waynfleet (afterwards Bishop of Winchester), when he had taken
the same degree, was called &ldquo;Sir Waynfleet,&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Chandler&rsquo;s Life,&rdquo; p. 54), Chaucer in his
&ldquo;Canterbury Tales,&rdquo; speaks of &ldquo;Sir
Clerk,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir Monk,&rdquo; and it even appeared in

(&ldquo;Religious Houses,&rdquo; Appendix, p. 167, note 40) says,
&ldquo;wherever the word &lsquo;Kir,&rsquo; or any of its
derivatives, is found, it implies a former Druid
temple.&rdquo;&nbsp; This syllable forms the base of the Latin
&ldquo;Circulus,&rdquo; and our own &ldquo;Circle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We find many interesting British names containing it; for
instance, in the name of that favourite resort of tourists in
North Wales, Capel Curig, we have the plural Kerig, implying the
British (or Druid) sacred circle of stones, while we have also,
prefixed, the translation of it by the Roman Conquerors of those
Britons, &ldquo;Capella,&rdquo; or Chapel.&nbsp; As a parallel to
this, we may mention, that in Wiltshire on &ldquo;Temple&rdquo;
Downs, there are some stone Druidical remains, which are locally
known by the name of &ldquo;Old Chapel&rdquo; (Oliver, Ibid., p.
175, note 66).&nbsp; Again in Kerig y Druidion, another place in
North Wales, we have the sacred circle &ldquo;Kerig,&rdquo;
directly connected with the Druids, in the suffix Druidion.&nbsp;
There is also at Kirkby Green, near Sleaford, a spot called
&ldquo;Chapel Hill,&rdquo; another at the neighbouring village
Dorrington (&ldquo;Darun&rdquo; the Druid sacred oak), and also

skeleton.&nbsp; This may probably be accounted for by the fact
that he died in the full vigour of life.&nbsp; Some of the
Boultons formerly resided at Hall-garth, Thimbleby; others lived
at Sturton-by-Stow, and left moneys for the poor of that
parish.</p>

proved 18th August, 1524, desired &ldquo;to be buried in the
church of Stixwould, before the image of our Lady.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Welbys are now one of the leading county families, yet we
find this very name of &ldquo;Thomas Welby of Moulton,&rdquo;
mentioned in the &ldquo;Myntling MS.&rdquo; of Spalding Priory,
as among the bondmen of that monastery.&nbsp; 25 Edward III.,
(1352).&nbsp; Thomas Grantham, living at Newstead farm,
Stixwould, 40 years ago, probably of the above Grantham family,
was a great hunting man.&nbsp; His brother, Redding Grantham, is
buried at Woodhall Spa.</p>

am indebted to the account of Halstead Hall, by the Rev. J. A.

resemble those of Tattershall Castle (built about 1440), and of
the Tower-on-the-Moor; they were formerly supposed to be Dutch
bricks, brought by boat up the Witham; but geologists tells us
that they are made of the local clay.</p>

Tom&rsquo;s head, after the execution, and a mould from it now
forms an ornament over the door of a house, No. 31, Boston Road,
Horncastle, which formerly belonged to Mr. William Boulton.&nbsp;
He witnessed the execution, and procured the cast at the
time.</p>
<p><a name="footnote206b"></a><a href="#citation206b"
class="footnote">[206b]</a>&nbsp; One of the gang was hanged on
March 27, 1829; the two above-named on March 19, the next year,
1830; a fourth was captured two years later, but escaped hanging,
as it was pleaded on his behalf, that he had prevented Timothy
Brammar, a reckless fellow, from shooting Mr. Elsey, or
ill-treating the maids.&nbsp; He, however, had formerly been a
servant at the house, knew the premises well, and was said to
have planned the whole proceedings; he was transported.&nbsp;
There were said to be ten men in the gang, all
&ldquo;bankers,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;navvies.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. T. Mitchell, parish clerk of Woodhall, informs me that two of
the men confined in the stables were named Henry Oldfield and
George Croft; names frequently appearing in the parish registers
and still common in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; George Croft died at
Langton, January 18, 1878.&nbsp; Henry Oldfield&rsquo;s daughter,
still living (1904), says that she remembers her mother stating
that she saw six of the men hanged, at one time or another, and
heard the trial of the last two, when the judge remarked
&ldquo;What, the case from Halstead Hall; shall we ever have done
with it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Most of these particulars are given in
&ldquo;Records of Woodhall Spa&rdquo; (1899), and for them I am
indebted to Mr. and Mrs. Longstaff, now residing at Halstead
Hall.</p>

entry &ldquo;Alison y<sup>e</sup> wife of Rob. Diton was buried
y<sup>e</sup> 14 Jan<sup>y</sup>., 1688,&rdquo; and as none of
the name are mentioned again, they probably became extinct with
this Robert.</p>
<p><a name="footnote210"></a><a href="#citation210"
class="footnote">[210]</a>&nbsp; It has been doubted, of late,
whether there ever was a tower; but it is referred to by Mr.
Jeans, in Murray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Handbook for Lincolnshire,&rdquo;
also in several old Directories, and the Parish Terrier, dated
June 27, 1724, mentions among the church possessions &ldquo;Three
bells and a ting-tang.&rdquo;&nbsp; The existence of this tower
is further confirmed by the fact that in the churchyard is the
tombstone of a Mr. Wattam (a name still surviving in the parish),
the churchwarden who caused the tower to be taken down.&nbsp; He
was afterwards killed by lightning, and the villagers regarded
this as a &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; upon him for removing the tower
and bells.</p>

Dighton, widow of Robert Dighton, of Stourton, there is a record
that she left her two sons, Robert and William, her leases in
Waddingworth, and in Maidenwell, Louth.&nbsp; This indicates a
connection. The Waddingworth property had belonged to Tupholme
Abbey.&nbsp; Maidenwell, also, was a sacred place, where is still
a well, in the cellar of the manor house, which I have seen,
dedicated to the &ldquo;Maiden,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, Virgin.</p>

class="footnote">[233]</a>&nbsp; The Beks, who have been
mentioned before in this volume, became a powerful and wealthy
family.&nbsp; They attained to the honour of Knighthood, and
Barony, married into families of good position, acquired the
Constableship of Lincoln Castle, and were especially strong in
Bishops; four members of the family being raised to the
episcopate, one as Bishop of Lincoln, then the largest See in the
Kingdom, another as Bishop of Durham.&nbsp; Of this last it is
related that he was so enormously wealthy that his ordinary
retinue consisted of 140 knights.&nbsp; Hearing that a piece of
cloth was said to be &ldquo;too costly for even the Bishop of
Durham,&rdquo; he at once bought it, and had it cut up into horse
cloths.&nbsp; While he was staying in Rome, a Cardinal greatly
admired his horses.&nbsp; He thereupon sent two of the best with
his compliments, begging the Cardinal to take which he
preferred.&nbsp; The cardinal <i>took both</i>; whereat the
Bishop drily remarked, &ldquo;He <i>has</i> chosen the
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote234"></a><a href="#citation234"
class="footnote">[234]</a>&nbsp; That a connection of Beks and
Willoughbys with Kirkstead Abbey existed before this, is shewn by
the following documents.&nbsp; Walter Bek, first Baron of
Willoughby, by will, dated July 20, 1301, directed that his body
should &ldquo;be buried at Kirkstede, whereunto he gives his best
horse (price 40 marks), his mail-coat, gauntlets, targe and
lance,&rdquo; and other accoutrements, Sir Willm. Willoughby
being his executor.&nbsp; An old Charter exists (Harleian MS.,
45. h. 14), by which &ldquo;John Bek, Lord of Eresby, makes known
to all sons of Holy Mother Church,&rdquo; that he grants and
confirms &ldquo;to God and the Church of the blessed Mary of
Kyrkested, and to the Monks there serving God, in pure and
perpetual alms, all the gifts and confirmations, which (his)
ancestors made to them&rdquo;; one of the witnesses to this being
&ldquo;Dominus William de Wylcheby.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote235"></a><a href="#citation235"
class="footnote">[235]</a>&nbsp; By a curious coincidence, we
find 120 years later, another William Hardigray, doubtless a
descendant of this, occupying the post of master, with sundry
&ldquo;fellows&rdquo; under him, of the Chantry of the Holy
Trinity, at Spilsby; and to him, and his Institution, Sir William
Willoughby, in 1406, granted certain lands in Scremby and
elsewhere, to augment the endowment; a further bequest being made
by Robert, Lord Willoughby, in 1452.&nbsp; (&ldquo;History of
Spilsby,&rdquo; p. 46, by H. Cotton Smith.)</p>

Marmeon, among the jurors is William Glover, of Panton.&nbsp;

same year, among the jurors is Robert Glover (Ibidem); and in

worthy.&nbsp; A friend, who, in his early years, received some
tuition from him, relates that he once took him to the top of the
church tower, and waving his arms around, exclaimed &ldquo;All
this should be mine, every inch of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He planted an
apple tree, when each of his numerous progeny was born; two or
three of which still bear fruit in the vicarage orchard.&nbsp; He
is said to have been a skilful boxer, and to have thrashed a big
bully at Thimbleby.&nbsp; Being accused by a clerical superior,
of frequenting public houses, and drinking too much, he replied,
&ldquo;I am not the only man who has been accused of being a
gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and
sinners.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was evidently well able to hold his own
with tongue as well as fist, although the valuable patrimony
slipt through his fingers.</p>

high, and an idiot.&nbsp; She was buried July 9, 1844 (note in
register).&nbsp; It is stated that her common way of showing that
she wanted food, was to lick with her tongue the
fire-grate.&nbsp; It is locally said that at the birth of each of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
